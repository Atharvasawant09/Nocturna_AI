1jpbz7v,"Recurring ""went too high in the air"" dreams for years.","I've had this recurring dream for years now. Well it is more something that happens within a dream.

What happens is, I will end up going into the air, whether jumping or going off of a ramp, usually in a car, but I will go higher than I expected. I will go up above the power lines and I'd say maybe...60 + feet in the air.

It doesn't feel like I'm flying though, I'm going up with the knowledge and momentum that I will start coming down. Kind of like...if you've ever been on a trampoline you can get pretty high but at some point there is that moment where you are inbetween going up and going down. And then there is just going down again.

Had this dream again last night. And I had to grab on to powerlines to keep myself from going and higher.

Sometimes i just land, other times I land sorta uncomfortably as if I was in a car that went airborne for a bit. 

Anyone ever have this dream or know why I have it? 

Edit: it is not a fun dream",18,21
1jp4gzc,dreams you had as a kid and have never forgotten,"Hey I‚Äôm currently writing a project that begins with a dream that a character had as a child and I‚Äôve been wondering what is it that separates child dreams from adult dreams. Probably life experiences and especially memories. I tried looking to my past childhood dreams for ideas but it‚Äôs all a blur and now I‚Äôm wondering in general does anyone have childhood dreams they vividly remember? 

Just know some inspiration may be taken into this writing but I‚Äôll only use what I get told here as a jumping off point for more ideas, I have no intention of ripping off anyone‚Äôs dreams. 

That being said, what dreams did you have as a kid and have since never forgotten?",46,83
1jp8hmv,I saw a past life in a dream,"It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve had this dream, but it still affects me to this day so I want to share about it here.

I‚Äôm Italian, so please excuse any mistakes. üôè

So, at the beginning of the dream I was a middle-aged man, living in an arabic country (can‚Äôt say with certainty which one) with my wife and daughter. A war erupted, and for some reasons we were accused as guilty, so we had to hide or they would execute us publicly. As a father, I decided to stay behind to make sure my wife and daughter could escape freely, checking the streets before them. At this point we split up, and I pass from being the father to being the daughter: I‚Äôm gonna say I was about 9/10 years old, I wore a hijab, and I remember seeing myself in the mirror and thinking ‚ÄúMy father is still with me, I have his eyes‚Äù and smiling because when I smiled I really resembled him. 
So it was now me and my mom, running and hiding. We were hiding everywhere we could, it was really really scary ‚Äî but, one day, we found a bakery. We sat outside, and we were rambling about the things we wanted to eat, I remember saying ‚ÄúIn my next life, I‚Äôll have bread, and I‚Äôll have breakfast everyday‚Äù and we saw a glimpse of the baker inside, but he smiled at us, so we kept on talking about food hoping he could offer us some‚Ä¶ but what we didn‚Äôt expect was the police arriving. The baker still smiling. Here, I realise he was not smiling for mercy, but because he found us and could report us. The police arrives, and we are taken to a plaza for our public execution. 
As they shot us, I could only think about the breakfast I would‚Äôve wanted. 
Then I died, and I saw the universe, and I was reborn as myself. 

Needless to say, I had the biggest breakfast of my life after I woke up.",18,3
1joujkd,"Fuck waking up scared, do you ever just wake up mad?","We all have woken up in the mididle of the night agitated because of a nightmare, but have you ever done so due to a frustrating dream? ",95,38
1jpi9vn,I had a nightmare I died and nobody answered my calls.,"Hi, Ive never posted here before. I just had this awful nightmare and when I woke up I just sat and cried for a while. 

For some context, my younger brother just got into a motorbike accident and thanfully nothing too serious. He's alright, just some shoulder damage thankfully. My mum and step-dad rushed down to make sure he was okay. I just had to cover some of his active night shifts at work so Ive been running on lots of broken sleep throughout the day too. Before my next shift which is during the evening, I got some sleep in at work while my partner was working so I hopefully wouldnt feel as tired when it was time for me to clock in.

I dreamt that I had seen a young girl, a bit older than a toddler, crossing the road without her parents noticing and car was oncoming. I knew this section of road. Its from a town near where I live and its an 80km zone. I had looked up from my phone when I noticed an oncoming SUV that wasnt slowing down. I was watching from a 3rd person perspective. Without even thinking, I ran across the road and pushed her on to the middle island of the crosswalk and got hit. 

I remember my shoulder caving in. I remember my ribs cracking violently. I remember I went under the car and my legs and hips got crushed by the tires. I remember hearing screaming and I looked up to make sure the girl was okay. She was crying because her hands got grazed. I remember her parents rushing over to her and someone calling me an ambulance. 

When I was loaded up, I asked one more time if the girl was okay before I asked for my phone to try and call my mum with my good arm. I was experiencing the dream in first person now. She didnt pick up; she was probably busy with work. I called my dad next and he said he was at work, that'd I would be okay and he was too far away, that I should call my mum again. I tried calling my fianc√© at work, but he didnt pick either. I tried my brother and then my mum again, but they didnt answer. I remember going to press the phone for my step-dad before it all cut away to me in surgery bleeding out from my abdomen. I remember the paramedics looking sad for me because no one picked up. 

Then I came back into 3rd person perspective and I saw my phone buzz and a doctor answering it to tell my mum to come to the hospital to say her goodbyes before they took me to the morgue. Then I woke up. I had to sit for a bit to process it, I clocked in for work. Then I just broke down crying. My fianc√© comforted me, but it was still such an awful nightmare. 

I get nightmares often, thats nothing new. I remember a lot them the next day or even months down the track. Most of them are zombie apocolypse related, some of them are just dark rooms with my loved ones hurling insults at me, some are just my family members leaving me. Ive never had a nightmare so awful as this though. I felt hopeless, powerless. I felt forgotten. 

Im going to be honest, I dont know what Im looking for by posting here. Advice? Other people who've had similar nightmares? Why am I dreaming this? I just.. dont know what to do about this or how to feel. This is genuinely one of the worst nightmares Ive had. 

TL;DR - I had a nightmare that I was in a car accident and in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, none of my family or loved ones answered my call to tell them I was heading there. I died in the dream, the doctor tells my mum I passed away when she finally calls back and then I woke up. Just looking for advice or anyone else who has had a similar nightmare. ",3,1
1jpi6rq,A weird dream I saw as a child.,"What's the weirdest is that my brain remembered it as if it was real.
I remember lying in bed in my grandma's house when I was like 6 or 7. It was night. There is a streetlight that can be seen through the window in the bedroom. And in my dream, I saw... I don't know how to properly describe it... The light itself separate from the streetlight, floating in different directions for sometime before returning to its place.

1jpdmuf,Had a dream about my house getting hit by a tornado.,"I was with my family in the basement, I was going to run upstairs to try to grab something to protect our heads like cushions off of the couch before my brother told me ""DON'T"" and right when he said that, I knew the house was getting hit. I yelled ""GET DOWN AND COVER YOUR HEADS AS BEST YOU CAN"". The house took a direct hit, the tornado was effectively right over us and I could hear nothing but the loud sound of wind and shit breaking around me. I heard my step mother scream while the walls were being torn apart. It felt like forever while it was over us, I'm talking a good minute of hearing the sound of this thing roar as it destroyed everything around me.

After a minute of trying to bear with the winds, I think I passed out in the dream. Then I woke up.

Yeah that dream was intense. Hope that doesn't happen.",5,6

I saw that an old woman wanted to read my palm and then she started to give me psychic reading.

She also said that I have affinity to the ""fae"" and if I work with them they will help me live a long healthy life and help earn money but I will have to work hard.

1jpfux6,Am I having Hypnopompic Hallucinations?,"

Recently I had woke up in the middle of the night and seen a black figure going into my bathroom (thinking someone had broke in) and i jump out of my bed ran into the bathroom yelling and trying to fight the thing, I woke up my kids and wife. My wife told me to come back to bed and me just standing confused in the dark bathroom‚Ä¶ this always happen in the middle of the night 3-4 am. For some reason I always wake up and still have vivid dreams/ memories and can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs reality or not. This happened to me numerous of times. 

When i was deployed last year Apr 2024 , I had 3 roommates and had to sleep on the top bunk.. In my dream, i was being in closed into something and yelled oh shit and ending punching the ceiling tile and split it in half.. very embarrassing bc i didn‚Äôt know my 3 roommates‚Ä¶

When i was stationed in Okinawa I‚Äôve had a couple of these moments or episodes, 1. I had a dream i had a pet snake on my bed and the snake had eggs and they hatched, i panicked and called a friend to help me get all the baby snakes from off my bed and under it. I then began to realize i was dreaming when i turned on my light and didn‚Äôt see anything‚Ä¶ 2. my gf (wife now) was sleeping over in my dorm and in my dream she had a squid wrapped around her legs and i hopped out of bed trying to pull the blankets off her while telling her to get up. ofc she‚Äôs looking at me crazy bc nothing is there. 3. In my dorm i had a couch and 65 in tv, i kept the box against the wall behind my couch. for some odd reason in my dream i had the urge to move the big tv box from behind my couch and put it in the middle of my room.. struggling the entire time. i woke up the next morning so confused as to why my couch and tv box was all out of order.

The earliest memory that i have was back in 2012, i was in middle school and just had moved to nj, we had moved into a new apartment and didn‚Äôt have furniture yet so i slept in the living room with my 2 other siblings. I woke up and seen a mouse running at me and i got up to put my pillow over it, i sat there for so long trying to figure out what to do next bc i didn‚Äôt want it running over to my lil brother while he was sleeping. i finally lifted my pillow to see nothing was there‚Ä¶why do i always have dreams like this and wake up still thinking im dreaming?",3,4
1jphnsv,I think I dreamt with people and the love of my past lives.,"I had the a dream where I think I contacted or got contacted by entities of the stars/past lives. I'm going to try to write everything as I remember and land my ideas as feelings as raw and near to what I felt there. 

I dreamt that I went to a foundation/research center about natural medicine that es near my house in my homeland. This place actually don't exist and where it was, in real life there only woods and a river. I dreamt I went there and talk with people working there about medicine and how life is connected to everything, the earth, starts, etc. There were many people there but there was this one woman who was with me the whole time and I felt like I was in a mixture of love and peace around her, I didn't want to leave her side. Suddenly she hugs me and tells me we have met in past lives and we have loved each other in other lives. I can't explain it, but when she hugged me I felt the most pure and real love I have ever felt in my life, it's not comparable to anything I have felt before, it was like being connected and in love with my partner that the universe/destiny decided. I really cannot emphasize nor explain the type and amount of love I felt, I felt peace, I felt time stopped moving, I felt love in a whole my way and spectrum possible, I felt everything  was and will be good, I felt I didn't belong here but up there with her, I felt I've known her forever (as long as my soul has been alive) and we have loved each other every moment of my existence. She told me she is in the stars and that we where together many lives, then she left. I was left with a feeling of emptiness but not bad, just empty bc of the feeling I cannot even explain that I just had. My dream didn't end there, I got home and told my dad what had just happened to me and he told me he had experienced that before and that everybody has a soul in the infinity/stars it is connected to and love in a way it is impossible to explain. The rest of the dream I tried to reconnect back to her, went back to the research center, she wasn't there anymore and the people there told me she went back, so I spent the rest of my dream desperately trying to get back to the stars to be with the love of my liveS again. Informing myself, swimming in the river, following the stars. I can't remember much more but it was the most real dream I have ever had I the most real and intense love I have ever felt. I didn't know it was possible for somebody to feel that way, at least not here in this body and tridimensional experience. It SUPER STRONG but calm at the same time, a type of love if have never felt even when I have my completely lost in love before, it was peaceful, it felt aligned but mostly it felt real. Her presence was love and peace to me, but when she hugged me, i felt something I will never be able to explain, I felt connected to the stars, to the universe as if I'm just visiting here and I belong somewhere else and the love of my whole existence is waiting back there for me. Now I don't know what to do or what to think, it was so intense and hard that I woke up feeling a bit empty about my relationship and life, not in a negative way, but rather as if nothing here will ever be remotely comparable. I want to understand what just happened and maybe be able to dream again about her again and ask questions if possible. 
Does anybody had an idea what just happened or maybe have some answers, I feel I felt in love with an soul that visited me in my dreams and I don't know what to do. Can anybody tell me what just happened or what could I do please. I appreciate you guys and thank you for reading me.",2,4
1jpf863,Anyone else‚Äôs dreams come true all the time?,"Mine tend to develop as warnings for reality, I have had many like this. One where I saw my family experience two funerals with people who would be involved later in reality in the dream. My mom‚Äôs sister and one of her daughters featured prominently. Later my aunt passed and we had two services for her in two different states. 

That is only one example but that‚Äôs why I worry, because I very recently had one where I was under interrogation and made to say words and confess to things that I did not do. Then I heard a voice whisper in my ear at the end, ‚Äúsorry it was the kkk‚Äù. That is creepy and I have been through serious problems with being hacked since 2011. FB messages sent to people I know but were not from me. So what the heck else should I think? The kkk still exists after all. ",3,2
1jpjwr7,Reoccurring stalking/abduction nightmares,"I take Lamotrigine 75mg twice a day in the morning/afternoon which might be helpful as context! 
I only started having these realistic almost lucid dreams after I started taking it like a year and a half ago. When I first started it I was dreaming of all of the past friends I made during my younger childhood. It was really sad but I ended up texting them and telling them about the insanity of my dream. They‚Äôre usually like super, super weird. Before I used to be able to distinguish when I was dreaming because I would have thoughts like ‚Äòif I do this it‚Äôll switch to the next dream‚Äô because I‚Äôd get anxious IN MY DREAM about the dream. Sometimes the dreams are so real when I wake up it feels like a memory not really a dream at all. Of course, there‚Äôs outlandish details in the dream so I know they‚Äôre not real at all. 
I guess my problem right now is that I keep having dreams of being stalked and kidnapped. It‚Äôs been going on for maybe a week now nonstop. Sometimes I can shake myself out of a dream if I get too scared and that‚Äôs literally what I had to do this morning. I feel like I had three dreams in one and I can‚Äôt remember all of them but I remember being in a car with another version of myself. She was in the front seat and I was in the back. We‚Äôre waiting for my fianc√© to get out of Kroger. Please don‚Äôt laugh I know this is stupid but of a sudden Arthur Morgan (yes, the cowboy) is like resting his hand on the car door trying to get inside to harm us. There‚Äôs another man outside and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúget the ice pick we‚Äôre gonna take the lock right off of this door‚Äù and I‚Äôm like crying stressed out and begging the other version of me to drive away. She jumps into the drivers seat and tries to force the key into the ignition but it‚Äôs like shocking her?? I force the key into the ignition by pretty much shoving her hand into it and then we like merge and all of a sudden I‚Äôm driving but there‚Äôs no gas so the car like teeter totters down the road? I‚Äôm driving in my hometown and the roads are the same as IRL but I‚Äôm going towards the ‚Äúcop station‚Äù (??) which is where Kroger would be IRL. Then the dream switched to me being in bed with my fianc√©. I wake up in the middle of the night and check my phone. I‚Äôve sent a million voice messages to my best friend telling her I‚Äôm scared and that I think I‚Äôm being stalked or maybe I told her that I AM being stalked. I go and listen to one of the voice messages and it‚Äôs a man‚Äôs voice saying ‚Äúhi üòù! I‚Äôm a deranged psychopath and I‚Äôve been watching you üíó! If you tell anybody or try to run away it doesn‚Äôt matter because nobody will believe you and I‚Äôll find you anywhere üéâ‚Äù his voice is just so cheery and sweet it‚Äôs so sickening. Immediately I woke up my partner and was like whispering ‚Äúwe need to leave someone‚Äôs in the house.‚Äù But I woke up in real life. 
Guys I‚Äôm so stressed about this. The day before yesterday I had a dream that I was sex trafficked or about to be and kept naked in someone‚Äôs house and ran away. Before I was having consistent dreams of being chased by someone. My therapist said it was because I was running away from something subconsciously in real life. I feel like that held some truth because at the time I had been seriously arguing with my partner about hurtful behaviors. After we finally found peace together the dreams stopped. I can‚Äôt think of anything that would be causing turmoil?? Like I‚Äôm on spring break at the beach I should be living it up tropic style but it‚Äôs 3AM and I‚Äôm stressed about a man who‚Äôs not even real",1,1

 I had a dream that i was at home with my family and my cat that's not longer with me, and suddenly a very small snake appeared on the floor - its scales were sometimes more red and sometimes more black in color - everyone started panicking because it was supposed to be the most poisonous snake in our area. My cat sat next to it and i quickly grabbed him because I was afraid he'd get bitten - some poeple appeared and caught the snake but then another, exactly the same looking one, slithered out from under a curtain and this time we asked my father to take care of it - he brought a wooden plank and only moments before he hit the snake on its head it turned into a red lizard - but it was too late - it got hit 3 times and made the most hearbreaking squeaking sound - I felt so bad for this poor thing, and for asking anyone to get rid of it",1,0

1jpjipo,Pain in dreams,"I don‚Äôt feel pain when I dream, no stinging no wincing, just feels like the worst drop in a rollercoaster where your stomach is so full of butterflies you are unable to move, speak, or laugh. That dreadful feeling that goes on for way too long. It‚Äôs only in the specific spots that were injured, the feeling spreads the longer I bleed out/stay injured for. 
I‚Äôve had a history of injuries, due to that: a high pain tolerance. I still feel it in real life obviously. 

Had a dream last night where I was stuck in a loop of dying in multiple ways, being killed by my loved ones. I felt the feeling of falling wherever I was injured and that feeling would soon engulf me whole. Leading to black for a moment, only to wake up and it happening again. 

My questions:
Why doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòpain‚Äô transfer to my dreams like other people? 
Just wondering if I was the only person who‚Äôs experienced this? 
Is it my brain trying to interpret extreme pain/death?

Just a couple of points:
1. Don‚Äôt have a girlfriend, never have

1jpj7se,INTENSE FEAR - People who abuse authority and sexually abuse their staff,"I laid on my bed, closed my eyes and felt like I immediately fell into a deep slumber. However, when I opened my eyes, I was standing in front of an old man and a bespectacled gentleman. I recognize that old man who claimed in my previous dreams, that he was a politician when he was alive in my dimension.

The bespectacled gentleman was handling a virtual screen that was floating in mid-air, going through different scenes and he looked disappointed. The old man was facing away from the screen, arms on his waist and he looked extremely angry. 

I walked cautiously towards the screen and figured that the old man must be angry at something he saw on the screen. The bespectacled gentleman saw me walking towards him, looked at me and shook his head disappointedly. I looked at the screen and saw a young man having sex with a girl in an office. The bespectacled gentleman spoke and shook his head, ""That's LML from the real estate developer CL, in his younger days. He abused his authority as a supervisor.""

I widened my eyes, made the ""oh"" shape with my lips and nodded slowly.

The old man was fuming and threathened through his gritted teeth,""I would personally HANG him with a tight noose and made sure he would never be able to SURVIVE or find any jobs in this region!""

I have never felt so much fear before and thought that I will most definitely die if he turned his anger towards me. The old man continued to swear and pointed hard at the air repeatedly but I couldn't focus on what he was describing. A lot of monks appeared and they were chanting. I recalled seeing a blur vision of a portal opening and suddenly woke up with intense fear on my bed. ",1,0

1jovnhl,World ending,"I had this dream between when I fell back to sleep at 8:30 this morning and I woke up at 9 am.

It was a different dream first and then it changed. I was looking out the window then became consciously aware of two moons in the sky. I thought one was the sun and the other was the moon, but I looked higher and noticed a bigger brighter thing, was that the sun? Then more things appeared behind it and I informed my family. They were fine with it until it was suddenly day, and it affected the earth, there was a random sign that showed the number of oceans increasing, and we started to evacuate. 

As we saw the military taking in people one by one we thought it was too slow and suspicious so we hopped out the vehicle and started running a different direction down the neighborhood. We started getting chased by the military, as we reached the edge of a street there was an ocean and someone idk if it was me or a family member ordered us to jump in. We did. 

We swam trying to hide before the soldier saw us but he threw something in the water, a family member dove in to grab and protect another from an explosion. We keep swimming away.

Someone throws down a latter and we climb up. The guy explains how he‚Äôs here and brings us inside, however before we could go downstairs he locks the door. The family not to worried about being locked inside when the world was literally ending outside asked for some food, my brother and I find a secret way out but cover it back up maybe for a ‚Äúlater plan‚Äù

I‚Äôm starting to freak out because the world is literally ending and we were all going to die so I grab my brother. I ask him if he was sleeping or dreaming or something. I can‚Äôt remember his answer. But I started to tug his arm, I was saying ‚Äúyou have to go and wake me right now. You have to wake me up.‚Äù And then I woke up.

This is not the first time I dreamt about multiple foreign bodies in the sky, I even had one about the sun expanding rapidly before snapping back in place. But this one was extra stressful, I woke up tense and scared. WTF",23,10
1jpi4rt,I keep having dreams where I'm friends with Donald Trump.,"I don't like Donald Trump.  I only mention that for perspective.   I will not engage in any kind of political debate or commentary here.   Reddit already has plenty of posts for that.  



So in my dreams I'm friends with President Trump.   He is the president in my dreams and I want toakena good impression with him, sometimes it's for some kind of material gain for myself, sometimes I just want the president to think that I'm cool or whatever.   He is generally friendly, though somewhat aloof.  


 These dreams are bizarre to me.   I wake up thinking ""what the hell was that?"".  I just wanted to share that I guess

1jpi1ah,Dead great-grandmother and flying Catholic priests.,"As with most of my dreams the majority is something that I cannot remember. The starting point of this recollection was my walking out of some sort of building, and seeing my 3 years dead great grandmother sticking waist high out of the ground. She had three eyes, one in the middle of her forehead like some reanimated Hindu deity. She had a Catholic priest with her. To my knowledge she was Catholic for most of her life up until her latter years. This ‚Äúshowing‚Äù of her by the priest was presented as a normal ‚Äúritual‚Äù or religious thing that happens periodically, where dead persons come to our world to visit with people. I remember speaking with her for some time, but do not remember the topics. I specifically remember the priest telling her ‚Äúokay, I understand, we will not have anymore colored people talk to you‚Äù. I am white, and I remember hearing him say this from behind a bush after she spoke with several other people. I only remember this because it was slightly comical due to her age. 

After this, the rest is blurry. I remember being in a soft-top convertible jeep and seeing the priest next to us. He told us that it was his first day as a priest, and then said he had to take care of something. He then proceeded to fly away. Literally flew like a super hero. This was accompanied by early 2000s Roblox flight sound effects. Like a ‚Äúwhoosh‚Äù sound playing over and over while he flew away. My friends that were in the jeep with me made fun of me as I was in awe of the priest‚Äôs flight. 
I‚Äôm still puzzled by this whole thing. I miss my great-grandmother dearly. She was the nicest person I have ever known. 

Just wanted to share. I feel as though this dream was different than my other ones. I haven‚Äôt been able to remember one this vividly In a long time. I think about her a lot, and I have been planning on converting to Catholicism for some time now. This is obviously related, but the situation of her temporary ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù is strange. I don‚Äôt know a lot about dream interpretation or the subconscious mind. ",1,0

1jphgr1,Strange teleportation dream,"I had a very bizarre dream that may be tied to multiple different phobias, such as claustrophobia and existential fear of the unknowns in the universe. But I‚Äôm wondering if any sci fi book or real world experiment could be the inspiration for it.

So Im visiting New York City with a friend, about to enter one of the subway tunnels, and it is an extremely cramped a claustrophobic opening that you have to climb though to get in. 

Once I was inside, instead of the normal subway track, there was a spinning platform constructed from the same material of the actual NYC subway track suspended inside a deep chamber. There was some sign mentioning something about electromagnetic radiation. I was scared to go inside but it was understood by everyone that it would allow you to instantly teleport to a new location by vaporizing and reconstituting the matter inside of you. 

I ended up chickening out at the end of the dream lol and just decided to walk, and let my friend take the subway.

1jphazr,Nightmare about being injected with something in my brain,"Tw: mention of abuse. 

So that ish was scary. 

I usually have nightmares about zombies but remember something happened and I got injured. I was surrounded by family I didn't know and then a woman's voice telling me she was going to inject something to make me feel better or ""normal"". Literally, I didn't feel the pain from the injection from being poked in the back of the head, but I swear I felt the rush of something like being underwater and that's when I woke up. I could still feel whatever it was in my head. I slept for like 2 hours and now I'm scared of going back to sleep. üòÇüò≠ I wanted to write it down in case I forgot but I was drooling when I woke up and I never do that üòÇ 

I just left an abusive relationship a month ago and I feel like the injured person was totally a catatonic real life version of me 3 days after he'd gone to jail. I've got some massive brain fog going on right now after waking up lmao.

1jpa1ae,This one hurt me and puzzled me.,"Bit of a back story here, when I was younger I dated a guy in the service. While he was deployed we would talk on the phone as well as an Instant messenger platform. While we were together but apart we would send each other gifts and letters and do silly things over webcam, such as flick lighters in a dark room and laugh while listening to music together. 
Before his second deployment he broke things off with me in fear of what could happen to him and how it would affect me. After that, I never heard from him again. 

So this dream, I was at work and saw a customer just kind of looking around so I asked if they needed help. They turned around (it was the guy I dated. And he looked just as I remembered him) he said no and I said if you change your mind let me know. I start walking to the front and he soon follows me and says ‚Äúso you knew him?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes, and if I knew you were coming I would have cleaned the place up more.‚Äù So we were chatting about what I remembered and the box of stuff I have irl from him got brought up. I laughed and told him my Mom had saved a box of stuff like his photos and such and he just rolled he head back and laughed while saying ‚Äúoh my gosh those old things?! Good job mom!‚Äù So then we start talking about how my life is. I said I have kids now and he says ‚ÄúI had a gf in 07‚Äù and I cut in with ‚Äúwhen you dissapeared‚Äù and he said yes before getting up to leave again. 
I woke up hearing one of the songs we listened to together. 

Why am I dreaming of someone I haven‚Äôt spoken to since maybe 2006? And if for some reason you are reading this, what? 

I‚Äôm so confused.

1jp9zta,A dream I can't forget,"Had this strange dream.
It felt oddly real. There was this wierd theme park supposedly located close, outside of my small town in a direction I hadn't gone before or atleast weren't very familuar with. It was positioned in an area where irl is just a massive forest. But in the dream, it had always been there and I hadn't heard of it till that day.
There was a point where I was on something bouncy that sent me flying up atleast a couple of 100 meters. Prior I saw this girl who went there too. Hard to remember if we flew on the long bouncy pad, at the same time.

For a moment, it was like time stood still. I saw the theme park bellow me, which oddly lacked a lot of rides. The jumping pad was like a a road on a grassy piece of ground which were licated at the edge of something simular to a mountain/ tall wide hill.

I looked up and saw what resembled my hometown or atleast the same direction of where it was positioned.
Before you get there if you are at the forested area, you have to cross an area with a smaller cartoonbox industry at the elder part of my town located about 1 km from the newer piece of my town

I don't know how I got there, to the theme park. All I remember is that some guy told me it were a place where everyone was hanging out. Kinda felt like I was missing out on something, like people had been there for ages and I just found out.
I knew I had been near it before, but, like it was positioned furthure away, almost hidden somewhere high up on a hill in the dense forest. But I never knew about it till that day. It was just somewhere people I didn't even know hung out on. It was just there and I didn't know.

While I flew in the air as previoucly meantioned, I didn't feel any fear. It was strange. I felt curiousity,  a sense of loneliness, but also a sense of being accompanied at the same time. I felt nostalgia and joy too.

The place did not resemble what it really looked like irl, but for a minute I hoped it was real and it felt more real than any other dream. I hoped I'd find people I had lost or new people I could befriend. I think I also missed what life was like when I was a kid.

He  who told me abkut the place specificly pointed out, cool people hung out there but in honnesty, I didn't think much of it. I use the term kinda softly.

I don't really know what all of it meant but it was strangely, not so bad. I think I miss something I used to have. Now it's gone.

It was just a cool place in a hilly area.
If I could show somebody how it all looked, I could get it all down perfectly. It was one of those dreams I can't forget.
If I could fly like I did, I'd do it every day but mainly just chat with who ever was around,  who could have told me more about the place.

No dream have caught my eye like this one in a long time.

1jpggf1,I had a dream where I raped an ex and felt really bad about it + some other odd stuff. Really confused about how my brain even thought of that.,"It started off at this road that often appears in my dreams + I often have in my lucid dreams so yh but basically the road is like a normal Polish road with this very steep dirt road that goes through the forest. Me and my friend were discussing if this other guy is gonna return via the dirt road and I was like nah he'll take the normal one next to it which he did. Then me and half of my class proceeded to take the dirt road to this village I don't like and there we went to the oddly large library building that only had an average small library inside. There, I saw my friend that doesn't go to my school on one of the computers (there was odly quite a lot of people) and we started talking and stuff. Then my class, the librarian, me and that friend that doesn't go to the same school talked a bit about random stuff and the crowd and then we proceeded to leave. After we left the building, we saw the school right beneath us where my primary school main teacher (?) was in this oddly large windows so we proceeded to wait until she went to the carpark where we talked a bit and she said I have a nice class. We then went to this mall and I proceeded to still call the place a shithole but then my friend pointed out that he doesn't think that a shithole has tk maxx. We talk a bit yada yada and then randomly I see the toilets. I then proceed to tell my ex to come with me for a second and then I took her to the toilets where I proceeded to randomly undress her. She asked me what I'm doing whilst doing that stressed laugh thing and then I proceed to tell her I want to have sex. She's a bit mad but she low-key just told me you should've just said and then she proceeded to light a matchstick and wave it around her vagina. I then ask her if she can give me hand job and then a bj and she agrees and she starts wanking me right but then I put my fingers in her vagina and she tells me it hurts a bit. Then she says she probably has some infection so no proper deed and I assumed the match was to hide the smell or smth. She then low-key be enjoying the hand job until these two girls walk into the toilet and see us. She proceeded to dress up and walk out. After a while (probably not the next day) I run up to her and hug her crying how I'm really really sorry about what happened cuz yk that was rape and she was like no it's fine and I asked her if I can kiss her neck and she was like sure and I just hugged her a lot crying like a baby. Then my class decided to go back home so we proceed to head towards this posh metro but the stairs take a while and we take the lift. The thing is, you needed to pay 5 z≈Çoty and I forgot so the lift took me down but really quick and the doors didn't open at the bottom. I get a bit stressed out but to make matters worse the lift starts spinning as if it were on some string and I start frantically putting in all the coins I had just for it to open. I somehow managed to spawn 2 z≈Ç, 1 z≈Ç and 1 z≈Ç out of nowhere (which adds up to 4 z≈Ç but dreams make no sense) and the doors finally opened. Turns out I was upside down in the lift and tumbled out and then the rest of the dream was me and my friends going to this lounge place waiting for our metro meanwhile I'm rethinking my life decisions in dream. 


What on earth could all of that possibly mean. I've never even fantasised about violent sexual stuff (heck, I find it disgusting) and it's all just so insanely odd. If anyone can decode that one heck of a dream I'd be glad because rn I'm a bit terrified of myself",1,2
1jpbx5d,I Met the Love of My Life in a Dream‚Ä¶ and Then I Woke Up,"Last night, I had one of those dreams that sticks with you long after you wake up. It started at a softball game, but not a normal one‚Äîour team was batting the entire time. No fielding, no switching sides, just hitting. And I was dead last in the lineup because, well, I sucked.

The game ended when the person ahead of me smashed a home run, winning it for the team. Everyone exploded into cheers‚Äîexcept me. I hadn‚Äôt even gotten a chance to swing, and it felt like I was just‚Ä¶ there. Useless.

Afterward, we all started walking home, or maybe back to school, cutting through this huge auditorium where a play was happening on the side (don‚Äôt ask me why, dream logic). At some point, I just veered off from the group. It wasn‚Äôt like anyone would notice if I was gone, so I stood at a distance, watching the play.

When the show ended, the audience got up to leave, and as I was stepping back, I tripped on something. Instinctively, I grabbed onto someone‚Äôs bag to steady myself. Big mistake.

‚ÄúFuck off! What the hell??‚Äù snapped the bag‚Äôs owner‚Äîa very attractive woman who was not happy about me yanking her stuff.

Now, I hate being yelled at, and I definitely don‚Äôt like people being mad at me, especially attractive strangers. So, naturally, I started profusely apologizing. She made it clear that it was fine and that I should just leave her alone. But did I listen? No, of course not. People-pleasing instincts kicked in, and I kept walking with her, trying to smooth things over.

And then she just casually dropped, ‚ÄúYa know, you don‚Äôt wanna be doing something that political in this environment.‚Äù

‚Ä¶What?

I had no idea what that was supposed to mean, but dream-me accepted it as completely reasonable and kept following along. Somehow, we ended up wandering through this European city, her brother trailing a few steps behind us. We talked, and‚Äîdespite our extremely weird introduction‚Äîwe just clicked.

At some point, the city melted away, and we were suddenly out in the countryside, sitting on a picnic blanket surrounded by fields of crops. It was just me, her, and her brother. And for some reason, I felt this deep connection to her, like I‚Äôd known her forever.

Then I woke up. And for the first time in a long while, my first thought wasn‚Äôt about what I needed to do that day. I just lay there, feeling‚Ä¶ calm.",2,0

They were black snakes with a green back, not even a forearm‚Äôs length- and if you thought you saw one, 10 more would suddenly appear out of no where. If you went outside or got anywhere near the proximity of the pool, the snakes would consume you and their bites would immediately lead to paralysis. In my dream my sister was explaining the severity of the snakes, at which point I questioned her, and she said ‚Äúlook at what they are doing to your dog‚Äù. The dog in my dream was the dog I had in college that also died in 2021. In my dream, the dog was near the pool when a snake crawled up and bit her. The dog immediately was paralyzed and fell over. The last thing I remember of my dream was the dog‚Äôs lifeless body being taken to the depths of the pool while snakes crawled over and consumed its body. What the hell does this mean???

1josw95,I've been having grotesque dreams...,"Sorry if what I am about to describe grosses you out.

I had my first tattoo done yesterday and this week I have been dreaming dreams that are way much more intense, they feel more ""real"" but the content of these dreams are something out of a body-horror film (Mind you: I hve not been exposed to any films of this type lately nor was I scared about the tattoo process)

In the first dream (Sunday) I was in my house watching TV when I felt an intense metallic smell (like what blood tastes like) I go to my room which seems to be the place where this smell is coming from, when I open the door I see this creature... It looks like an inside-out person, organs exposed and everything, it is laying on top of my bed having sex with god knows what! Is like another inside-out creature, barely human.

The second dream (Monday) was the night of the day I had my tattoo done. In this dream I also just had my tattoo done but I was in some sort of wedding and had a full tuxedo. As the ceremony begins my body starts itching all over, when it becomes too much I go to the bathroom to check whats going on, when I take the tuxedo off I am COVERED in blisters, warts and bloody scars... It felt, looked and smelled so ""real"" that just thinking about it rn makes me sick, and my reaction inside of the dreams wasn't much different since I began to vomit because of my body's condition.

I hope I don't have more dreams like that this week, I guess they all have to do with the tattoo and some subconsious fear of a bad outcome in the healing process of it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but I'm not sure.

1jpe3l7,The Red Room,"It starts as a lucid dream. I'm upstairs in my grandmother and grandfather's house, looking down at my hands knowing for sure that I'm not awake and in the dream, this has become recurring as of late - seemingly random some nights. I'm wearing some sort formal wear, blazer and shirt, nice shoes, comfortable trousers - the works. I feel like hot shit, the man, and I can feel every step down the stairs of the blurred red and orange staircase - the not so one-to-one replica of the family home, far too vivid in orange from the radiant light outside and deep, velvet red that coats and submerges the house. Its calm, pleasant, even quiet. The living room follows this same decor and no ones there to greet me, empty, not because no one is in - but because no one else is in the neighbourhood. Silent, except from the outside rumble of soft breeze and chirping birds. Then I look out the window, and there's this man - I don't see him outright, only his shadow. But it's like a smudge, this smear across the concrete that projects his image, outfit and being. Wearing a black suit, holding a briefcase, real government official type stuff. He sees me peering at him, looks at me and gives me a cheeky grin - somewhat playful, it's definitely an acknowledgement to me but meaning no harm. For the life of me my brain tells me he looks like Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks, but I think I'm just trying to fill in the blanks. I wake up.

I've never saw the show, up until recently, and the dream happened like a few months before I've watched it. But I've had an instance of just feeling a red presence wash over me before in the waking life - something I felt there. I have an inkling that guy was trying to find me - not to hunt me down or anything but for something, there's a slight feeling that we'll meet again. Just after that dream, I've been getting massive amount of deja vu in real life from dreams - it was very prevalent during a trip with a friend where it kept happening 24/7 when we went anywhere in the small town we were visiting and many other small events that feel like they give me a little hint as to what to expect next in an incoming day during the week or the week to come.

I really want it to find a shelter, becuase of the cold, even if i didn't feel it, i chould still tell it wasn't good. After a while of wondering around, i manage to find a wierd car in a form of a house. The inside had a lamp, a computer, heater, and a simple bed. After looking around, i manage to find out the computer had control all over the car, with all the information i need. I could see it didn't have a lot of energy left. Around 3-4 hours left before it would run out of power. With not a lot of options to choose, i choose to just turn off everthing except the heater, to save power. Knowing it as just a matter of time untill the cold would get me after the power runs out, i just lie down on the bed, whaiting for it. And after that, i had wake up.  
After that, i can't remenber how i had felt after awaking up. ",1,1
1jpdehv,Concert dreams,"Have any of you had a dream that you were at a concert or even a performer in one?  It can be any genre of music.  Last night, I had this one where the seating and the stage kept changing when I'd change my view.  First it was like a school that had a stage in its gymnasium and the seats were arranged like they were socially-distanced.  One seat that stood it was the one with someone I sing with in a symphonic chorus.  The next view had tables and the left half of the stage was taken by a block.  Then I took my seat and the stage was back to normal but I found myself sitting on a bench and long table.  It was crowding with a woman and her misbehaving kids so she told her kids they were leaving.  I felt a sense of relief and as they started to leave, I woke up.",1,0
1jpcx22,Woke up wailing again,"It's happened a few times in the last few years. Usually someone dies, more often than not it's about my grandfather who has passed 17 years ago. In the dreams he's alive, but there's hints that's he's close to his final moments, and there's always a letter. Last time i was able to read the letter before waking up and it was short so i remembered it.
This time it was too long and i was too caught up in distressing thoughts to read it. The letter was a little ripped and it was addressed to my grandmother who was beside me. It was a map, and he had written over it, all over the place.

While we held the paper i just thought "" what if he dies, he can't die, i wouldn't be able to take it."" I was already crying and in intense despair at this point.

Then i thought ""I'm so lucky that i still have him, i need to enjoy my time with him while i can"" but I didn't feel relieved at this thought. "" Wait, no. He's gone, in my world he's already gone, this isn't right""

And just as it was turning into a lucid dream, i wailed myself awake and even as i opened my eyes and realized it was a dream i couldn't stop wailing, quite loudly too. There were no tears this time (which is a first, maybe I'm getting used to it) but the pain in my chest was so great.",1,0

For example, last night I had a dream that last year, this (nonexistent) medium sized city in southwestern Ontario near Kitchener/Waterloo named Selham experienced a devastating fire in its downtown, but every single resident evacuated the town and it became a ghost town really fast, and everyone compared it to Chernobyl, but unlike Chernobyl, it was a lot more intact, and in the dream I had a long phone conversation with my dad about this where I said how sad it looks seeing pictures of this town abandoned, and I was in my room and I distinctly remember talking to my dad on speakerphone during this dream. (In the dream) I also found out Amy Lee from Evanescence was from Selham (in the dream, not irl), and she was posting a lot about this on her instagram. When I woke up I was still convinced this town was real and I actually googled Selham Ontario just to make sure. ",2,2
1jpayy8,lingering feelings from a dream character,"I had this extremely vivid dream last night. I hardly ever write down my dreams straight away upon waking, but after this dream I immediately started jotting it down. The connection I made with this character feels so transformative. The plot of the dream itself is not as important so I will be leaving a lot of it out, but here is some context: 

It was a zombie apocalypse dream and most people had already turned into a zombie. This wasn't the stereotypical movie zombie, they were exactly like functioning humans, they just wanted to eat our brains...   
But I was hanging off a building and listening to them have a meeting about how they are going to take over. I got spotted by one and they started trying to chase me. 

It then turned into a tree jumping dream, where I jumped from tree to tree, but then I found this guy who had this home secluded in the trees. I was frantic and terrified. He had this calm, all knowing energy and he gave this smile that I can't get out of my head... it said ""everything will be fine now"" . I immediately trusted him. He told me they wouldn't be far behind and that we had to fight them. I was terrified but he instilled a lot of confidence and security in me. Basically he gave me comfort and the will to fight. I could see a huge line of zombies making their way over to our tree but when I looked to him, I was filled with ease and that I knew I could do it with him. 

A big fight broke out. This really vicious douchy zombie character ended up killing my guy, who I ended up killing eventually, but my guy was long dead. 

Basically, I can't stop thinking about the feelings of comfort, security and connection this character gave me. 

What do you think? Has anything similar happened to you?",1,1

1jp9bau,Four nightmares in one night.,"I went to bed with a headache from what I assume is the weather/pressure changing. Then I had these dreams in the order they are listed. I don't know if they were caused because of my headache or anything. But today after having the dreams I've just been off and felt so paranoid. Usually with nightmares I don't remember them but for some reason I remember these ones vividly. I put these all in the same post because I don't know if they are connected or not. I know the first and last ones are connected though.

Dreaming of falling off of a string/rope bridge but holding on and someone saving you: 
I was walking on a bridge and it was white with white plastic/wooden(still sturdy) pieces going across it, then it had white string on the sides. Then I slipped and fell but luckily I grabbed onto the string/rope on the side. I was screaming for help and eventually someone came and helped me back up onto the bridge. I don't think the person was significant because I don't remember anything about them.

Dreaming about a rocket ship exploding on its way to heaven:
So there was an Irish rocket company and they had previously tested their rocket with spacex and now they were ready to have actual astronauts go. So they get them into space, me and my family are watching it on a tv broadcast and there is a commentator too. They are planning on going to the outsides of heaven and coming back to Earth. After a bit they are close to heaven and all of a sudden the commentator just yells ""NO!"" And me and my dad look at each other with shocked expressions. He puts his hand over his mouth and we just stare at each other for a minute in disbelief. My heart literally dropped when he looked at me like that. Then I woke up in real life. 

then getting unexpectedly bombed when someone you love isn't there:
I was at my grandparents house sitting on the couch and my mom was somewhere else. We got a weather alert (the one that comes on tv with servers thunderstorms) and we couldn't tell what it was saying. We just assumed thunderstorms but then my friends text ""we're getting bombed?!"" And I yell to my dad who is on the couch across from me, then the house starts shaking and outside you can see red and black flashing(like explosions). I text my mom because she isn't here and I try to type I love you but I can't. Then time jump to what I'm guessing is a couple minutes later or after the bombing stops. I text my mom and ask if she's okay and she says yes but there are bears. Then I wake up in real life.

Bridge again but this time your family falls too:
This time my sister and mom and me end up in the one hanging on, then my mom is hanging onto my leg, and my sister is hanging onto my mom's leg. My sister lets go and I tell my mom that now we can both get up if she just swings a bit, but she ends up letting go too. Then I woke up in real life.

1jp8h2l,weird dream i had months ago i cannot stop thinking about,"i wrote this down on my notes app when i woke up and for some reason this dream had been plaguing my mind the last months because üò≠üò≠ idk i feel like ive always had weird symbolic dreams but this was the maximum level here it is,

 

 had a dream that there was somebody in our house, and my family was there too. at some point, i realized i was inside a dream, and within the dream, i tried to find meaning behind something. while still dreaming, i decided to search for the meaning of the moon. to do this, i had to ‚Äúaccess‚Äù the moon, and in doing so, i saw countless stars and galaxies around me. i was riding a horse, traveling through space toward the moon, as if it was a destination i had to reach.

when i finally landed on the moon, i discovered something called the macula lutea and something about a heliosphere‚Äîbut i don‚Äôt fully understand what those meant in the dream. it felt as though i was uncovering something important, like the dream was guiding me to some kind of knowledge.

at some point, i woke up from the dream‚Äîbut i was still inside another dream. there was someone there, a person i can only describe as ‚Äúthe sky.‚Äù it was as if he existed to analyze my dream with me, talking me through what had happened. he told me he had been explaining everything to me while i was dreaming so i could go even deeper into it. but strangely, he was also asleep as he spoke, like he was part of the dream itself, guiding me from within.

then there was another figure, someone religious or spiritually significant. he told me that even inside the dream within the dream, there had been a monkey with me. the monkey was speaking, and it said it was happy that an afterlife existed because it had been tortured by humans. the monkey talked about how birds also suffer at the hands of people and how god had created an afterlife so that they, too, could find peace. it was strange and unsettling‚Äîalmost like i was hearing the thoughts of something voiceless, something that had been waiting to be heard.

when i finally woke up for real, i had no idea what any of it meant, but the feeling stayed with me. i couldn‚Äôt remember everything that happened in the dream i had woken up out of, but i knew that the experience had been profound, even if i couldn‚Äôt put it into words.

1jozlgh,Anyone else dream like this? [Partial Lucid / Narrative],"
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my dream style‚Ä¶ 

- Narrative Dreaming - 
My dreams play out like full on stories, with emotional arcs, missions, symbolism, and sometimes even plot twists. Not just random fragments, these feel like episodes in a longer series.


 - Third-Person Perspective (Default) - 
I almost always dream in third person, like I‚Äôm watching myself from just behind or slightly above. I only switch to first person when something intense or emotionally loaded happens.


 - First-Person Shifts (Situational) - 
When something big happens, danger, a decision, or emotional intensity. I‚Äôll shift into first person briefly, then zoom back out. It‚Äôs like I need to ‚Äústep in‚Äù to really process the moment.


 - Hybrid Lucidity (Veil Communication) - 
I don‚Äôt fully control my dreams, but I can send messages to my dream self or even influence a scene when it goes too far off track. Sometimes I just drop in a thought or command like: ‚ÄúNope. This isn‚Äôt real. Try again.‚Äù ‚Ä¶and it works.


- Emotional Atmosphere Tracking - 
I remember the mood of a dream more than specific details. Like the exact feeling of the air in a dream room, or the energy of a silent hallway. I might forget the plot by the time I wake up, but never the vibe. 


- Messaging Dream Characters - 
Sometimes I can influence a whole dream scene or characters from the outside, like I‚Äôm the director whispering from behind the veil. Not often, but it‚Äôs happened. And while I can whisper from behind the veil every time whether they listen or not or how they interpret my instructions is a gamble. 


- Dreaming with Emotional Gut Checks -
I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúgo with the dream.‚Äù I use my gut to make choices, even if they break the dream logic. Pretty much in most cases I can stop nightmares before they happen or consciously refuse to do something the dream is trying to make my dream self do. I don‚Äôt control the details just kind of.. bark orders? And the dream will adapt. So my gut will tell me if something is about to get scary or bad and 7/10 I can stop that from happening. 


 - Rare Lucid Overrides - 
Occasionally I can shut down a dream entirely and wake up if it‚Äôs too much, or take a moment to completely reset it. Doesn‚Äôt happen often. On the flip side sometimes I can also wake up for whatever reason be fully conscious for a little bit and decide I‚Äôm going back to that specific dream. If it‚Äôs within 20 minutes or so of me being awake about 5/10 I can successfully go back to the dream like it never stopped and when I wake up remember even more details of the dreams than I did before. I don‚Äôt control the dream details still but it‚Äôs like tuning back into an episode I paused for a moment. 


So. Does anyone else dream like this? Do you use third person view regularly? Switch to first when needed? Communicate with your dream self? Love to find dreamers like me!

1jp8256,Constant negative dreams some including shootings,"So as of recently my dreams have become almost daily,  everytime I sleep I have a dream and ( I have depression and struggle alot mentally) most of them are negative often including something violent such as shootings , I think once I was the perpetrator but the other times it was someone else.

1jp7i4t,Dream story: Green Hallways,"Alot of my dreams are like stories. They always have a plot with characters and always strange and creepy settings. I never thought to write them down or visualise them but this one was particularly interesting and is still fresh in my mind.

The story takes place in a cold icy, snowy setting. Trees are lacking but snow is abundant. 4 (or 5?) researchers all set out to explore this particular area for some reason. Maybe there were reports of strange and peculiar activity? Maybe someone saw something? Either way it sparked enough oddity to cause these researches to investigate. The area seemed normal to them, I remember they joked about how it was probably just an animal someone saw or they were someone crazy, or high, imagining things. I remember the sun was almost about to set, still bright, but on the way to getting low, when one of the researchers was on the frozen solid lake and noticed something strange below. There was a dim lightly with no source. I remember it caught his and his attention only with no one else believing him. He shrugged it off and they continued exploring, getting their job done so they could go home quickly. As the sun got lower the sky turned a soft pinkish-red. A small hill or mountain near the lake was their next location they checked out. I remember one of the researchers was looking ahead of the group and somehow fell down a hole into a small cavern. The whole opened up and swallowed him down below. The researcher was luckily fine, but this cavern was deep and incredibly dark. The group panicked for a second but the fallen researcher below assured him all was well, and actually encouraged then to come down when he noticed a weird light. I remember he approached it from afar and peered between a hole in the wall of the cavern and saw an icy structure with a feint dim white light. Icy pillars and structures all surrounding a water fountain like structure with a floating icy ball there between it all. I remember this is when one of the researchers talked about stories of a mad God who lived in this area. Who made himself insane and his friends around him and was lost to time. And that this structure reminded him of that story(?). The team advanced to further investigate and decided to approach it. The dim light became a little less dim as they opened the hole enough for them approach it.

The icy structure seemed pristine, pillars of chiselled ice amongst the walls of the cave. Rocks and ice would poke through all while next to a untouched ice fountain frozen. There were 4 pillars in each corner, a fountain like structure in the middle and a floating ball the size of a bedroom made entirely of ice. It rotated and spun with little to no explanation as to how or even why?? The final detail the team noticed was the modern office like door bestowed in front of them against the wall on the other side of the fountain. How was there a door in here? In the middle of nowhere at what seems to be an ancient structure. The team went more and more quiet and when approaching the door as anxiety and uncertainty filled their body. It was beginning to set in that nothing here was normal, but curiosity still roared past their bodies cry for fear and anxiety. 

They openened the seemingly normal door to what looked like a hallway. A dark, dimly light office hallway with a carpet floor, roof and walls. The light was little and the only thing keeping these hallways lit was the ocassional bright green light emerging from nowhere. The light scattered the walls in seemingly no order or form. The hallway had a few doors spread across which never opened and paintings on the walls that were incredibly uneasy.  Faces of disfigured or abnormal people with a dim yellow light behind it looming in the greenish-darkish light of these hallways. The team was now completely silent but exploring further and further. The hallways repeated one after another with forking paths into other hallways all dark and always lit by random bright green lights.

After the hallways I woke up and tried to write down this dream as quick as possible. Super weird üò≠ and creepy. I used ai to visualise my dream (cause I cant draw for the life of me) and this picture is extremely accurate, even scarier in actual picture form. Lmk what you guys think",1,0

1jos8kk,One of the most horrifying dreams I've ever had.,"PLEASE BE AWARE THIS POST CONTAINS MENTIONS OF SA AND LOSS OF A CHILD

  
I need to put this down somewhere before i forget it, i tend to want to remember my dreams as a way to understand where my mind is at times. Please understand that this is  a very long and story like dream as it felt it went on forever.

  
It started with me and my boyfriend going into a tattoo shop and double checking when his booked appointment was, as we needed to go to the doctors across the road from it,  when we was talking about his tattoo that he was getting, he mentioned to me that he wanted to wait to go to Japan first before getting one. Next thing I know we are in Japan walking towards our hotel with a few other people I knew from different parts in my life i don't speak to anymore. We get to the hotel and unpack everything and i decided to head to the 7/11 down the street by myself, as I'm walking i hear this meow, like a high-pitched meow, so i follow the sound down this alleyway and i find the cutest tuxedo kitten by itself, all scuffed up and hungry. Then I realized I don't know where I am, I don't have my phone, only my credit card and this kitten. I try retracing my steps,  but no luck. I try asking for directions in the little Japanese i know, nobody is acknowledging me. At this point it's getting dark and I'm panicking now, all the streets look the same and i realized I'm fucked.

 I go to sit down on the floor next to this wall as it's fully dark outside now and to regather my thoughts on what to do, I blink and I'm in this basement, with the kitten that's now in my front shirt pocket, in this moment I'm shitting myself because I'm in a different country, hardly speaking their language and I'm in a random basement. After awhile my dream kinda skips to something horrible. I was being SA'd in that moment, I don't wanna go into to much detail but it was very realistic and it makes me feel sick even thinking about it now. Then my dream skips to me being pregnant, still in the basement and the door is open, so i run up the stairs and i end up being in a restaurant type thing and i run tf out. As i'm running down the street i start to give birth. The baby was premature and i couldn't walk properly so I for some reason decided to put it in my back pocket in my jeans and run (I still have the kitten by the way in my shirt pocket). So i'm running down the street in the night and it hit me that i've seen that building before so i run further down the street and i see the hotel. I run in, looking for my boyfriend and i see my old friend from high school and i am sobbing, barely able to stand up, she looks terrified seeing me and starts asking me where I've been and what happened and i literally can't get a word out.

Then it cuts to my childhood house and I'm in the bathroom with my mum, she's running me a bath, i still have my clothes on from what happened. I get in the bath and she's washing my back and hair and she's asking me what happened. All i can remember saying to her was about my baby being in my back pocket, as soon as i said that i literally lost my shit, i was screaming and wailing whilst trying to do CPR even though i knew it died long before. Then i woke up.

I don't know what this dream is about but god is scared the living shit out of me when i woke up, like fully sweating and shaking.",7,1

I‚Äôve moved since then, and I constantly have dreams now relating to the paranormal that almost always take place in that same home. Is this just my brain digesting the traumatic events I experienced or is there a deeper meaning? 

Also, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I don‚Äôt remember having a dream about my old house without there being some kind of paranormal event taking place. Would really like to get the attention of someone who has experienced supernatural happenings to help me un-pack this.

1jp4fii,Dreamed of an unkown spirit,"After a month of poor sleep I am finally getting my sleep back in order. In the early hours of this morning I had this interesting dream.

I was with my mother and sibling at some unknown location that felt familiar in the dream. We were being asked by a non denominational priest to do the last rites for someone. We were huddled in a circle and asked to place our hands on top of each other in the center and say a particular set of words together. Something like ""grant this family member safe passage to the after life so that he may rest in peace..."".

I could see the dead person's spirit at the entrance to the room, standing side ways to the door. He was looking into the room but not at anyone in particular. As I type this I realise he could be my father's older brother who died many years ago. The two men look similar, but the dead man's spirit looked like a young version of them and he wore a purple t shirt and jeans. He had short cropped hair.

In the dream I was uncertain about doing the last rites but the people in the room were urging me to finish the ritual because even though we didn't know where he would go, they said he couldn't stay here. After the ritual he seemed to linger a bit and then disappear but I kept seeing him everywhere and was uncertain if it was my imagination. Then I woke up.",1,0
1jp4d7e,Dreams becoming reality,"Does a dream becoming a reality actually mean anything? For context, I live in an upstairs flat, and we have a neighbour downstairs. If something happens up here it tends to be a problem for downstairs. One time I just bought a washing machine and it leaked everywhere because the pipe broke and it flooded downstairs. Last night, I had a dream where I was living in a different house and my neighbour had lived above me instead, and then it had leaked downstairs to me like water was coming down like rain. Tonight, I just finished having a shower when my neighbour knocked on the door telling me our shower had leaked through once again. I am quite spooked as I literally had a dream about something similar last night, but then it could be just my subconscious because ever since the washing machine accident I tend to have dreams about it sometimes.",1,1
1jp48fd,"I had a crazy dream that I can‚Äôt explain, help me","Last night when I was sleeping I had a intense dream, it was placed in a dystopian reality where I was a soldier with my cousin. Nothing to crazy but the part that gets me is I felt like it was entirely real. My cousins mom had a house in the dream and it was so beautiful with intricate architecture. I remember all of it , i don‚Äôt know why. I remember a woman helping me and telling me to get out of the war that was going on. Later on in the dream I got a letter from her with a firework attached to it. I think I disregarded it and went to smoke with my cousin (weed). When I smoked, I felt it entirely and I was high in my dream just as I would be in real life. There was some women soldiers me and my cousin met up with, for some reason we all ended up on in a hot tub at the house I mentioned earlier. a very weird looking hot tub. I remember the girl touching me and I remember touching her. I can still remember the sensation of touch exactly, and the memory is like it truly happened. 

When that girl was telling me to get out of the war (I can‚Äôt recall her name) it was so scary and real. It was literally the midst of war and she helped me get out of there. I remember her yell ‚ÄúYou have to get out of here, you have too!‚Äù 

I believe when I got the letter from her it was a big time skip after that happened. 

I woke up shortly after the hottub event. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it and I‚Äôve never had a dream like this ever. 

Does anyone know what this could mean or possibly help me understand why it was so real? I‚Äôm sorry if the timeline is all messed up. ",1,1

1jp39g0,Was in a body of a rich man's life.," The dream started with me holding an RC passenger plane. There was little awareness that it was a dream, but not full lucidity. The plane could be rotated and inspected at will. It had two propellers on each wing, the same kind used on cheaper drones. There was even a thought of strapping another toy truck to it just to see if it would still fly Kid at heart here. üòÜ

Looking around, the setting became clear. An extremely large room with multiple pillars, dimly lit, and filled with green plants. The ceilings stretched about 40 feet high. Shallow, rectangular ponds or pools sat just a few inches from floor level, easy to step into. Their purpose was unclear, but the water was clean and warm. I had to google what it could be just now.  Possibly a courtyard spa or bathing hall in a luxurious home.

Walking through the home led to a living room with a large TV. A woman, maybe in her early 30s with a thin build and long brown hair, was inside, organizing things and barely acknowledging my presence in the room. The realization hit, she was the wife.
Moving into what looked like a gaming room, the setup was mesmerizing. The love for modifying computers in real life made this dream system even more fascinating. A dual PC built into a large glass-top desk, liquid-cooled with multiple pumps. The back was open, revealing braided pipes. Some warm, some not. This marked only the second time in a year where temperature could be felt in a dream. Awe-struck, every part was inspected for about three minutes as I felt every part. The wife entered as the system was being admired.
""Did I build this?"" ""Uh, your father helped you,"" she replied, sounding unenthusiastic.

Exploring further, a pile of mail caught attention. I picked out the junk mail. Groceries ad, lawn care ad, and a Burger King flyer among them. Walking up to her near the dimly lit kitchen, I asked her ""Where does the recycling go?""
""I don't know. Right there?"" she gestured toward a bin behind the trash. After tossing the papers, there was an urge to hug her. She barely responded. ""I feel different,"" I said, but no response came. The realization settled in, the man who had been ""taken over"" was wealthy but not well-liked by his own wife. 

Trying to play it off, the next step was figuring out a way to ask about the debit card pin. ""What's the pin to my debit card? Sorry, totally brain farting lately."" ""We don't use debit cards. Just the credit card. It does have a security pin. I1PP.""
Standing there, thoughts raced, was this guy some kind of famous YouTuber? How was this going to be played off? What if work was required? And how? Still, the dream wasn‚Äôt fully recognized as one.

The bedroom was the next stop, with the wife following. Entering, an audible ""Whoa!"" slipped out. The room was massive, with a table covered in party supplies, as if a big celebration was being planned. I looked at the large bed white a fluffy white comforter, bringing an uneasy feeling, like invading someone else's space. A tall goblet-shaped glass was filled with candy corn. I grabbed a few pieces and ate one. It tasted exactly as it should!

Walking back out into the main room with the pillars, the wife was now holding a toddler. Without considering it might be our child, I offered the little boy a candy corn by putting it in his mouth. ""I don't want him having one,"" she said, removing it from his mouth. He started crying, and guilt sank in. Walking away, the confusion grew. I laid down on the fancy brick floor next to one of the shallow pools, the toddler approached, still looking for candy. He layed next to me as I was dragging my fingers through the water. ""Sorry for being a jerk,"" was whispered. ""Yes, you are,"" he replied in his little squeaky voice.

Getting up, the next stop was a bathroom, huge, with a walk-in shower that had three partitioned showerheads for privacy, like something out of a gym. Inside, an older teen and another boy, possibly Filipino, were showering with shorts on. Respecting their space, a quick exit was made. The thought came, how many children were actually in this household?
Dreams lately had been filled with NPCs as I call them. Sometimes entire crowds. Wandering into the laundry room, there was a utility sink. Turning to the wife, I asked ""Can we go for a walk?"" The plan was to explain everything, to tell her that I wasn‚Äôt really her husband. She wasn‚Äôt interested. The feeling of guilt overwhelmed, and a hug was given from behind. This man must have been a real prick. How am I supposed to take care of them if I don't remember anything?

There was an entrance to what looked like a sauna room or maybe a wine room? The walls were lined with cedar but the room was empty.. Inside, a younger boy, maybe eight years old, was playing with a six-inch Luigi figure built from Legos.
I asked ""Can I talk to you?"" A slight hesitation. ""I guess...""
Wrapping arms around him tightly, uncontrollable sobbing started. He started crying too, probably confused about what was happening. The sadness was heavy. It was obvious this family had been neglected. Crying harder, lucidity finally hit. A fleeting thought, could my actual wife, lying next to me in bed, hear me crying?
Then, waking up. Turning to her, most of the dream was shared. I asked if she heard me crying but she said no. She went back to sleep while I was lying there for twenty minutes, trying to make sense of what had just been experienced and to remember more details.",1,2

My other friend ends up getting possessed by the dude cause he's really a demon. She ends up basically repeating the first part of the dream and he stares at me with black hole eyes, smiling like a psycho.
The first friend was gone so she still doesn't really believe it and the one that got possessed admitted that she didn't fully believe me until it happened to her.  

At one point I leave and mine a diamond like in Minecraft and find a pink diamond but they fall off a cliff so i jump into get them landing in water and was admiring the pink diamond.
I end up back where I started, I keep trying to collect my things to leave but keep dozing off and walking around like I'm drunk. People are just being civil with me cause they're still not sure if I'm lying about everything and I'm really sad the whole dream.

I take a hormone drug as a trans woman(progresterone) and had forgotten to take it sunday, so I doubled the dose yesterday to 400g. I think that's what caused this dream.

I was at buffet, or at least it seemed like a buffet. They said only guests were allowed to eat. Which sucks since the food looked really good.  In the next scene, I was in the bathroom and looked into the mirror and saw this strange dude looking back. Like not a nightmare, dude, but rather just some random dude with a patchy beard.

 But this time, the man hanging was my father. Someone else was there too as I grabbed my fathers body and put him on the sink, I don't remember his face.

Normally, cutting hair can mean grief or freedom, feathers can be good or bad. It wasn't the hair from my scalp tho. In my dream I was just doing my routine to clean myself up, reached down and found a strip of pubic hair. I was able to pull it taught and cut it (no bad feelings about it in the dream, just a ""dang I really missed a spot huh, wow that's long"" vibe). After cutting it down, the ""loc"" of hair turned into a pile of (possibly) crow feathers. They were pretty and smooth, almost like fake non-fluffy feathers from a craft store. I was caught off guard, but felt fascination looking them over. I then put them in a bag for future use in spell work (I'm pagan for context, so collecting feathers for stuff is a pretty normal thing even irl)

1jourpz,Dreams about a loved one being alive many years after their death,"I lost someone very close to me about 14.5 years ago. He was murdered and it was very violent, headline news, etc. I dealt with PTSD for years afterwards but with therapy and time, everything seemed to kind of settle down and be fine. 

In the past 6 months, though, I've been having dreams every now and then where he never actually died. He's just been somewhere else; or more inexplicably, he might be dead or alive but there's no confirmation. 

There is no violence or sadness in these dreams (though I sometimes wake up a little sad,) and there usually aren't many other people involved besides maybe his parents and myself. 

His mom and I did not have a good relationship when he was alive, so I reached out to her back when these dreams started and it seemed like time had healed whatever the issue was there. She was very kind to me for the first time ever. I thought maybe that's what the dreams were pushing me to do, but I'm still having them once in a while. The rest of his family and I got along great when he was alive though I lost contact with them shortly after his death bc I just couldn't handle it.

While I waited, the snake started shedding its skin and morphing. It slipped out of my hands and bit me four more times before leaving. Some cops arrived at the scene before the ambulance, where one started lecturing me about keeping a snake close after biting me. He pointed out a picture would have been sufficient in identification. The ambulance was taking forever so he put me in the back of his cruiser and dropped me off in front of the hospital. I got checked in but the ER was extremely busy and because I wasn't taken in by ambulance I had to wait an hour when I was called back I stood up and got really dizzy and fainted.

She was my first everything, and I can sincerely say that she was the first person I ever loved. But, we were both quite mentally unwell, and I was awful to her, I pushed her away and never forgave her for her mistakes during the relationship. I was also always consumed by the idea that she was ‚Äúslighting me‚Äù, and it‚Äôs only been recently that I have realized just how wrong I was about some much of our time together. The way we broke up was awful, she dropped out of school for mental health reasons, and we did it over the phone. I had developed a pretty nasty (but conscious choice) to spend oh I don‚Äôt know, the last 2months of our relationship verbally berating her about her problems and mine. Overall, I was a piece of shit, and I was too scared to ever accept her love. I now recognize my patterns as abusive, and am staying clear of relationships for quite a while. If it helps, when I say she was the first person I ever loved, I mean that incredibly literally.

Most important context:
I saw her on campus recently.

 Basically, in the dream, I saw her on campus, but in a spot I‚Äôd never been. She was with her friends, and was happy, which she rarely was with me, which makes sense. Then, I went to her house, to finally say to her what needed to say. But it was bizarre, it was my childhood home, and her entire family was there, ready to make me hit the road. Then, she stepped outside, and she was MUCH taller than me. More context about me, I‚Äôm shorter as a guy, and it was never one of the main issues of ours, I guess that‚Äôs obvious now because we were dating, but I did put a consistent amount of effort into goating her into making it a problem. Moreover, I knew that she always wanted to be taller, as her whole family was much taller. Then we talked, and she listened to me, and then asked me if there was anything else. I said no, and she gave me some interesting life advice then walked inside. And I drove away, only seeing her dad just pulling in. But he was driving my dad‚Äôs car.

This dream was of such a different flavor of the typical dreams I‚Äôd have about her. And this one feels like it will be the last.",3,1
1jou13y,Getting ready for a long drive,"In the dream, I was getting ready for a long drive. The car was ready and fully loaded with lot of stuff. I had decided to go alone. My husband and father were standing near me to send me off. Suddenly I realised that I had to drive a long way all alone. I had learnt driving long ago but never drove after that. That too all alone on a highway with superfast cars. I got really nervous and started to think why I decided to do it in the first place. I then talked to my husband and mentioned about texting to a friend of mine if he could come halfway through to help. I suddenly got up and the dream ended abruptly. Thoughts?",2,1

1joyzws,Dream Explanation Please,"Long story short. I had a dream I was at my 2 year olds daycare helping out with all the children. I went to go leave and get her and there‚Äôs a little girl that is running around playing, I thought it was my 2 year old but turns out it was actually me as a baby. I then hear my 2 year old saying mommy come get me, come get me and I turn around the corner and I see my baby in black and white while everything else was in color. Immediately disturbed in my dream I ask the daycare lady if she sees two kid and the daycare worker says ‚Äúyou‚Äôve definitely lost something.‚Äù

I immediately woke up and did not want to go back to sleep after this. Hugged my baby extra tight. 

A little back story. I‚Äôve been trying to get pregnant with a second kid for a little while and the last time I had a dream this vivid and scary was after I found out I was pregnant with my first. Haven‚Äôt currently had a positive pregnancy test. 

Also, my twin brother is also headed to prison next week from an accident and don‚Äôt know if it could symbolize something with that and maybe I wasn‚Äôt seeing my 2 year old in black and white but it was actually my twin brother. ",1,0
1joaori,I had a terrifiying dream about my mom telling me I'm going to die soon,"Throwaway account because I'm honestly a bit embarassed about how much this is bothering me.

So my mom passed away 4 years ago. Having dreams about her is not unusual, but not as frequent as it used to be. Last night I had a very vivid dream where I saw her and it felt very realistic. I hugged her and we hung out for awhile. Usually in my dreams she isn't a dead person visiting me, she's alive and usually there's been like some mistake where everyone thought she was dead but she wasn't. Anyways, flash forward a little bit and she's laying in bed dying again (this is another common occurrence of these dreams) I said something like I wish she could have stayed longer, and she said something like, ""oh you don't need to worry, you'll be joining me soon."" That really freaked me out. One thing to note is I am not a very spiritual person, I'd like to believe that really is my mom visiting me in dreams, but I also am skeptical of everything. My mom believed that her deceased loved ones would actually appear to her in dreams sometimes, so because of that I'm freaking out that this is real. I CAN'T die soon, I have family on Earth who needs me. I'm only 25 years old, I've just begun to heal from severe depression and mental illness. I haven't lived yet. I don't want to die. Please knock some sense into me. Thank you",49,44
1joewgb,I got to see my sister and meet my niece last night in a dream,"For some quick context, my older sister was murdered in late 2021 and she was 7 months pregnant at the time. Both her and her baby died. 

Last night I was having a dream that took place in the neighborhood where I grew up. This was one of those dreams that just felt so real and vivid. I was walking around the streets when I ran into my sister. She was holding her baby who appeared as an infant in the dream. I hugged her, crying, and started leading her to my parent's house. I've never lucid dreamed before and I can never realize when I'm in a dream, but part of me knew this couldn't be reality. I remember I just kept repeating ""we need to find someone so I can make sure this isn't a dream"", because I thought that would somehow prove it was real.

I couldn't find anyone since nobody was home, so we both sat at the kitchen table. At this point my worries about it being a dream were starting to fade. I chatted with her, so happy to get another chance to talk to her (this had been one of my biggest regrets after her death. COVID had been running rampant for a while when she was killed, so I hadn't gotten the chance to see her in person for nearly 2 years at that point. I'm also the kind of person who rarely texts. I just wait until the next time I see someone to catch up).

She introduced me to my niece. I got to hold her and see her, something I never got the chance to do since she never got the chance to be born. She was a beautiful baby.

Then the dream took a dark turn, as they tend to do for me. The baby went limp, dying in my arms right before I woke up.

Obviously the end of the dream is quite disturbing, but I'm used to morbid and distressing topics invading my sleep; most of my dreams these days tend to be leaning into nightmare territory. Overall, it was a very nice dream. I got to experience something I'll never get the chance to in my conscious state. Since I didn't know I was dreaming, I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my sister, but I got to see her again, talk to her again, and meet my niece.

I know that it was all just a dream, but it's nice to think that there's the smallest chance that I was somehow actually seeing her one last time.",30,3
1jotqnb,Three consecutive vivid dreams,"Hi! For three consecutive nights, I have had these vivid dreams that seem engraved into my mind. I‚Äôll describe them all briefly to you all! I‚Äôm also really hoping you guys can help me interpret them (especially the second one because I am a hopeless romantic!)

1. My mother died after an operation that she is meant to have soon, which ended up with me waking up and sobbing at 1am?! 

2. 
- background info - There‚Äôs a boy that I‚Äôve been interested for quite a while now and we‚Äôve only texted/snapped before although we live in the same city. I feel very differently about him and I‚Äôm very straightforward and have made it clear that I wanted to see him but I did not feel reciprocated. I‚Äôll give more info on that if you guys would like 
THE DREAM: 
I was on a holiday with my family, and him and his family also ended up coming and somehow our families knew each other (impossible lol), but regardless, I didn‚Äôt know he was coming till the last second, and so they told me where he was and when I finally got to where he was he had left, and it happened again, I went to where he was and he had left. It just felt like such wrong timing, but it felt right because it was with him. Then towards the end of my dream it seemed as though I finally saw him, and he saw me. It was on a farm, the weather was cold and cloudy, and I‚Äôm pretty sure there was a cow??? 
Weird dream am I right‚Ä¶?

DREAM 3: 
I was sitting in the living room and it was dark, my hand was in my mouth and I was playing around with my teeth. I noticed my top back tooth was wiggly and there was a tooth grown underneath it? And so I pulled that tooth out, then I did it again with my other back teeth on the top and bottom, left and right hand side. Then as I was talking I looked down and my teeth were just falling out one by one, almost crumbled like paper. It just felt so sinister and weird, truly hated it.

1jowy01,"Help me make sense of my childhood dreams, and why they relate to my life so much","Hi, I just made this account because I watched a little too many YouTube videos and now I want to make sense of my own experience. 

      When I was a really young kid (I wanna say around 3-4) I used to have this awful reoccurring dream where me and my parents would be on a boat in some industrial/factory setting, very surreal. My parents would stop at a building, leave the boat, and climb into this giant fan that even three year old me knew would kill them. It freaked me out every time I had that dream, to the point where my mom would have to wake up and comfort me in the middle of the night. 
     After a few years those dreams stopped, then a different, more wholesome dream also revolving around boats came into play. There was this figure (that I can‚Äôt imagine in my head so I just interpret it as a cloaked figure) that would row this boat around, and we would just travel to places that my younger self liked at the time. I remember one time it took me to Halloween Town. (Kind of weird, I know.) 
    I think another location I frequented was this seemingly abandoned and run-down town that was inhabited by monsters, but they were all friendly. There were other things in the area too, like other abandoned buildings and roads. There was even this freaky neighborhood where strange figures would chase me out of it. There‚Äôs not much else to say about this one for now, but it gets pretty weird later. 
        I stopped having these dreams so often after a relative who I was super close with had passed away, around 4-5 years ago. Maybe at most a year after he had passed, I saw him and that figure from the boat one last time in a dream. In this dream there was nothing fantastical, all I was doing was sitting in my relatives house, eyes closed next to my relative. I heard some voice ask my relative if I would be ok without him, and then I suddenly woke up sobbing. I‚Äôm not exactly the most spiritual person, but that experience made me believe something was out there. 
      Tying back into the dreams earlier, it‚Äôs probably a good time to mention there‚Äôs a river behind my house. It‚Äôs just a boat ramp now, but  it used to be a road that‚Äôs now just gated off and abandoned. Across the river, there used to be a whole town/community that the gov had torn down to prep for the flooding of the river. I only figured out about it later from word of mouth, almost nobody talks about it even in my community. 
       
       That‚Äôs all I can say without becoming TMI about my personal life, but as long as people don‚Äôt ask where I live I‚Äôll answer questions. This stuff has freaked me out because it connects so well. Did my brain as a young kid just predict the town across the river or is it a complete coincidence? ",1,1
1jow7xi,Flying dreams,The dreams where I feel the most lucid or like myself are where I‚Äôm flying. I‚Äôm often flying between and around people on the ground and also am able to sing beautifully. I feel like an angel/ghost because the people below can‚Äôt fly and I‚Äôm still among them but distinctly different from them. It‚Äôs so freeing and wonderful. I feel like these are the dreams that are different levels of consciousness rather than just processing dreams because they‚Äôre completely different from my other dreams. ,1,0
1jos0tc,I had a dream where I poisoned my cat,"I woke up sobbing from this dream, which is odd, because I don't dream in the first place. As a heavy daily THC user, i havent dreamt in a while because of the way it disrupts your REM cycle. When I do, it's usually small strings of nonsense that my brain tries to splurt out, without vivid sensations, emotions, or  even a solid setting to feel oriented in. This one was so fucking different. I couldn't even tell that it was a dream until the very end, this one was so realistic. I live with my boyfriend and his cat, Perry, and I've bonded with both inseperably. In this dream, she had gotten cancer, a mass in her stomach, and for some fucking reason, I had a small vial of cyanide and the equipment to inject it. I did it, shaking, And I still don't fucking know why. Why would you put down an animal with cyanide? Regret washed over me and the rest of the dream was spent petting her as she wheezed and stiffened, and all of the sensations, sounds, even the environment felt so terrifyingly real. Holding her in real life felt exactly like holding her in the dream. Her stiff, cold fur felt real, like the body of my childhood dog that I buried in December. in the dream, I had panic googled the lethal dosage of cyanide in cats, regretting everything, and it was 2ml/kg. I looked it up when I woke up. Dream google was right. How was it fucking right? If this is a premonition, I can't do it, man. The best dog I've ever known died four months ago, my mother is dying to her brain bleed, and I can't lose Perry. Im holding her now. ",2,1
1jow2gl,Recurring Dream ‚Äì Part 1,"Feel free to let me know if you've ever experienced something like this‚Äîsuper realistic, yet as if watching from the perspective of an observer.



For days, no, weeks, I've been dreaming the same dream over and over again.

I find myself in a spacious apartment overlooking the city. A small terrace and a conservatory are within my view. The terrace is surrounded by a beautiful hedge of roses.

The apartment consists of a large dining room, adjacent to a spacious living room with simple decor. In the dining room, there is a modern kitchen with an integrated counter. Before reaching the terrace, one must pass through a small conservatory. The terrace itself is enclosed by a lovely hedge covered in roses. I am in the top-floor apartment of a high-rise building in a big city. It is a gloomy day, and the rain is pouring down. I stand in the kitchen, staring through the large glass front and the conservatory into nothingness. In the background, ""Once Again"" by Clay Edwards plays softly.

A young man sits at the wooden dining table in the large room. His face and clothing resemble that of a British student who has just been faced with the biggest decision of his life. A key turns in the lock of the massive wooden door. I flinch. The door opens with a soft creak. A familiar female voice breaks the silence: ""Honey, I'm back. I met‚Ä¶ on the way and invited her over for a drink."" No response. Another ""Honey?"" I let out a small ""Hm,"" which is drowned out by the sound of the door clicking shut. Well, even the hum of a bee could have drowned it out.

Every now and then, the young man at the dining table can be heard softly clearing his throat and pondering. The two young women enter after placing their soaked shoes under the heater and hanging their wet jackets on the hooks. Beaming, they step into the dining room. Another ""Honey"" jolts me out of my trance as if struck by lightning. I turn around abruptly. The young, stunning girl with her blonde-brown, chest-length hair cascading over her shoulders looks at me in shock with her deep blue-green eyes. She says, ""Honey, are you okay? You didn‚Äôt mention you were expecting guests."" With a tense expression and barely moving my lips, I reply in a slightly uneasy yet calm voice, ""Neither did I."" Immediately, I ask, ""You have guests?"" Slightly unsure whether I had simply forgotten that she was bringing someone or if she had never mentioned it at all.

Was ist Abschied?

Der Moment, in dem ich etwas zur√ºcklasse?
Der Moment, wenn ich sage: ‚ÄûWir sehen uns‚Äú?

Ehrlich gesagt, wei√ü ich es nicht!
Ich tr√§ume seit Tagen, nein, Wochen immer wieder denselben Traum.

Ich befinde mich in einer ger√§umigen Wohnung mit Blick auf die Stadt. Eine kleine Terrasse und ein Wintergarten liegen in meinem Blickfeld. Die Terrasse ist von einer sch√∂nen Rosenhecke umgeben.

Die Wohnung besteht aus einem gro√üen Esszimmer, angrenzend ist ein gro√ües Wohnzimmer mit schlichter Dekoration. Im Esszimmer befindet sich eine moderne K√ºche mit integrierter Theke. Bevor man auf die Terrasse gelangt, muss man durch einen kleinen Wintergarten. Die Terrasse selbst ist von einer sch√∂nen, mit Rosen bedeckten Hecke umgeben. Ich bin in der obersten Wohnung eines Hochhauses in einer gro√üen Stadt. Es ist ein d√ºsterer Tag, und es regnet stark. Ich stehe in der K√ºche und starre durch die gro√üe Glasfront und den Wintergarten ins Nichts. Im Hintergrund l√§uft leise ‚ÄûOnce Again‚Äú von Clay Edwards.

Ein junger Mann sitzt am h√∂lzernen Esstisch, der in dem gro√üen Raum steht. Sein Gesicht und seine Kleidung erinnern an einen britischen Studenten, der gerade vor die gr√∂√üte Entscheidung seines Lebens gestellt wurde. Ein Schl√ºssel dreht sich im Schloss der massiven Holzt√ºr. Ich zucke zusammen. Die T√ºr √∂ffnet sich mit einem leisen Knarren. Eine vertraute Frauenstimme durchbricht die Stille: ‚ÄûSchatz, ich bin wieder da. Ich habe... auf dem Weg getroffen und sie eingeladen, auf einen Drink vorbeizukommen.‚Äú Keine Antwort. Ein erneutes ‚ÄûSchatz?‚Äú Ich gebe ein kleines ‚ÄûHm‚Äú von mir, das vom Klacken der T√ºr, die ins Schloss f√§llt, √ºbert√∂nt wird.

1jovlsp,Wood Paneled House/ Three White Cats,"To preface: I usually do not dream unless it is something weird. I smoke a lot of weed so that may have something to do with it but, as a kid it was the same as it is now. 

I keep having a kind of reoccurring dream. It‚Äôs not the same thing that happens each time but it‚Äôs at the same place. This house with a wood paneled inside and outside, there‚Äôs a long back porch that‚Äôs raised about a story off the ground and a staircase down about midway thru near the glass doors to the inside. On the left side of the house, there‚Äôs a main staircase but I knew I couldn‚Äôt enter the top 2 floors. Never got any more info on the house layout other than a crazy bad gut feeling. 

I‚Äôve dreamt that my irl pets were there before and I was very stressed about them getting outside. In one of them, there were 4 other people with me and my dogs, someone had let them out to pee and as I realized I ran outside and snatched the old one up and yelled at the young one to go in. We got in okay but it was the same feeling as when I would think about the top 2 floors. 
 
Anyways the last dream I had there was 2 nights ago. It was the first time I saw something that was abnormal. There were three white cats there and I knew two of them were my own pet black cats that had somehow had a different body. No idea why there was a third one there.

1jov50y,"Can this be explained by just stress, or do I need to talk to my doctor / therapist?","Last night I had a very vivid weird dream. It would fall under the category of ""nightmare"" however my nightmares spit into the two subcategories of ""weird"" and ""horrifying"". I have had vivid dreams my entire life, some have been so vivid that they have stuck with me forever after having them. I also have ""good"" vivid dreams, but those usually feel like ""just a normal day"", and then I wake up and have a moment of, ""Wait that didn't happen yesterday, it was a dream."" I have these vivid dreams multiple times a week, and some weeks its nearly every day. I have always chalked them up to ""stress"" as I have been some level of stressed my entire life with very few periods of ""calm"". The thing is Im 25, almost 26, and I was kind of under the impression that I would have less dreams like this / less dreams I could remember as I aged, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I know a lot of different factors can affect dreams, but I can also cross a lot of those off the list. I have a very ""normal"" sleep schedule, average 8 hours a night, and I never go to sleep more than 30 minutes after my ""normal bedtime"" and never wake up more than an hour after my ""normal wakeup time"". I don't do ""hard"" drugs, I occasionally smoke weed, and drink sometimes, but on those days it seems to prevent the dreams or maybe just make me unable to remember them when I wake up, so I don't think that's the cause. I do have a lot of trauma, but the dreams aren't usually related to my trauma. For last night's specifically I could chalk several aspects up to anxiety or stress, but that's not always the case. Some nights it's bizarre dreams that might metaphorically represent my anxieties, but they aren't directly related, and so I'm not 100% sure. I guess I'm just worried about the frequency of occurrence or vividness. Don't get me wrong, the content is typically unpleasant, but the thing that is making me question the normalcy is that I don't know anyone who expierances the consistency of vivid dreams I do, or that remembers them in the way I do. I know a lot of people that are the same or similar levels of stressed as me, and when I try to talk to them about it I usually get a, ""Hm, how weird "" ",1,7

I just launched something called The Dream Exchange.

Here‚Äôs the concept:

	You tell me your dream ‚Äî something you‚Äôve always wanted to do in the U.S. but never had the time, space, or freedom to make happen.
I go out and live that dream for you.
I document it fully ‚Äî the emotions, the journey, the story ‚Äî and send it back to you in a way that feels real and unforgettable.

Why?
Because I have the time, the courage, and the drive ‚Äî but not the resources.
You might have the money, but not the freedom.
So let‚Äôs exchange.

I‚Äôm currently trying to raise $100,000 to fulfill 20 unique dreams across the U.S.
Every $5,000 will fund one dream.
A portion of the funds will also help me get a proper education and build a bright future for myself as a software engineer.

This is not a vacation. This is a human mission ‚Äî to live for others. To bring meaning. To create unforgettable stories together.

If this speaks to you, or you want to be part of it ‚Äî even just by sharing your dream ‚Äî I‚Äôd love for you to check it out:

1jo9l36,Met a lady in real life who I used to have recurring dreams about,"           This is long/.  When I was a child I used to have the strangest dreams. Not nightmares but like the weird ones where the dream characters find out you‚Äôre dreaming and they aren‚Äôt supposed to. Or like dreams that seem to have a whole connecting plot and it seems like I wake up on cue. I was aware I was dreaming a lot of the time but never fully ‚Äúlucid‚Äù to where I could control the dream it was like me knowing I was dreaming was apart of the dream if you get what I mean. Just strange dreams in general which have pretty much stopped happening entirely after i entered my early teens. I actually remember a lot of them.

    A lot of my weird dreams were recurring but this one always stuck out to me because it involved the same character but the dream itself was different every-time. There was a house in my neighborhood that no one lived in. The dream would always start with me walking out my house at night and walking over to the empty house in my neighborhood. All the houses were dark and unlit except the house no one lived it. The windows would be open and you could see the light coming through. And there was a little Puerto Rican lady that lived there and she spoke really broken English.

    I remember the first time I had the dream and I met the lady. It started with me walking outside and coming to the empty house but it was all lit up and homey. I was confused for a second and then I realized I must have been dreaming so I thought nothing of it and I walked up to the door and just walked inside. The lady was there and I wasn‚Äôt scared or anything I just sat down with her. I don‚Äôt remember all the details but I know it felt like we talked for hours just about life. I had to have been no older then 8. 

  I dreamt of her many times after that and she was almost like an imaginary friend but only in my dreams. I would talk about problems at school and at home and she would tell me about her life. I remember one time I asked her if she could come see me in real life and I don‚Äôt really remember her answer but I remember me being aware that she was truly just a dream and she seemed to know that too. I eventually stopped having those dreams but I always remembered her. I was always scared to walk by the house in real life.  

Come to present day I am married and have told my husband about these dreams years ago. I started a job at a retail store a little over a year ago now. I still work there. Pretty much all of our customers are regulars we don‚Äôt get too many new faces. A couple months after I started there was a woman shopping who I took notice of really quickly because she just looked so familiar. I was so confused because I thought there was no way I could know this woman like there‚Äôs just no possible way. Nothing could have added up to make sense of where I knew her from but I just had this super strong feeling that I knew her really well like I felt like I wanted to give her a big hug and tell her I missed her lol. 

   I thought i was just being silly until she actually approached me the next time I saw her. Like I said, the woman in the dream didn‚Äôt really speak good English the in real life lady didn‚Äôt either. But she approached me like she knew me with a smile on her face she said, ‚Äúhow are you? Beautiful girl‚Äù and kind of leaned in for a hug. I was so confused still maybe thinking I knew her from somewhere because she seemed to know me too, so I hugged her back and tried to like  act normal because I didn‚Äôt want to be rude if I actually knew this lady. She small talked me for a little bit and then we said our goodbyes. I walked away still confused and trying to figure out where I know her from and it clicked . I swore she was the lady from my childhood dreams.. I know I sound crazy lol I told my husband and he thought it was creepy but obviously didn‚Äôt think much of it. 
  
    I know it‚Äôs really crazy but after a year of working there, she still comes in always happy to see me. She always gives me hugs and asks how I‚Äôm doing and tells me I‚Äôm so pretty. It‚Äôs like the weirdest thing because it became normal to see her and I almost view her as just a normal regular that I have a great connection with but I still can‚Äôt get over the whole dream thing. There was never a formal introduction with this lady it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs just always been an unspoken thing that we are really good and everytime we see each other in my store we just have a connection like we‚Äôve know each other for years. I don‚Äôt even know her name but she‚Äôs acted like she‚Äôs know me since day one and she‚Äôs never questioned how or where we know each other either. At this point it feels like I know her from work but I never even really met her she just walked up one day like she knew me and we‚Äôve had interactions like that lever since. 

I thought my experience was interesting and I just really wanted to get this out there to others who may have had similar experiences or insight. IK it‚Äôs a long read ",27,11
1joteny,Alligator dream,Hi! I didnt even know this sub existed but I just had the strangest dream that I could use some help interpreting. In my dream I had a pet alligator and it was longer than I am tall. It was even sleeping in my bed like my other pets do but I realized in the dream I was scared of it and was trying to call animal control to take it away so it didn‚Äôt accidentally snap and bite someone or eat one of my cats. I do also remember a strange part where I was putting lotion on it and there were two like holes in the tail that the lotion was getting stuck in (kind of like when you butter certain types of bread). I think when I imagined them taking my pet alligator away in the dream I felt bad and was really sad. I‚Äôve never had a dream like this before!,1,1

1josng2,Weird but awesome dream,"I just woke up from a dream (awhile ago, trying to get as much as I can out before forgetting) that was kind of a combination of Beetlejuice (ghost/demon agent of chaos, and a girl), ghosts, and other undead stuff. I'm sorry I can't remember more details, large chunks of the dream are missing. Why isn't there a dream recorder like in Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within?!? Argh, anyway...

There was a town by the beach, and the girl (not Lydia, but gothish) likes this one dude (like a depressed jock). All the townies knew about it, but it was kept secret for some reason? They go to a carnival and show off their throwing accuracy to each other (games, hitting people with annoying objects, skipping rocks...). The mom of the girl found out and tried leaving the town, only for undead vampiry grandma (think BJ 2 movie-the ex-wife, but nearly skeletal and gray) to show up. Vampiry mom (think a blend of Bayonetta and Lady Demetrescu with runeish tattoos all over) also revealed herself. There was something about a ritual needing to be completed, dude shows up to defend girl, there's a green flash and dude goes into the future-by less than a year. The carnival's going on but has a gloomier feel, and the girl's at the carnival all melancholy like. Due to not Beetlejuice guy, the carnival got warped and twisted in the background while dude got her attention. Excited, they relive the carnival memories and she informed him of the ritual and being unable to escape. Dude and townies get plans to try preventing the ritual by killing grandma. The plan almost worked because at the end of it, grandma gets launched into the air where there was a barn ledge she could hold on to. Since she wore a sunroof cloak, as she hung there the first hand was burnt up, then second hand, then while falling...

I should also mention this dream was partly musical, and the songs were actually pretty good. The reason I woke up at this point was because the last lyrics were, ""Watch her remains fall into a pile of cel-er-y!""

I woke up and was like, where'd that celery part come from. WTF? And knew I had to post it here. Some for interpretation, but mostly for a good laugh for you guys.",1,1

1jo23xs,The Triangle-Headed Beings From My Dream ‚Äì A Contact Event Through Dreamstate (Drawing Included),"Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been having profound dreams and meditations that feel like more than just internal experiences, they feel like real contact events. On March 29, 2025, I had the most powerful one yet. In this dream, I encountered three beings whose appearance, energy, and presence have stuck with me like nothing else I‚Äôve ever known.

Attached is a drawing I made from memory, completely guided by instinct, no hesitation, no second-guessing. It flowed out of me like I was remembering, not imagining.

What They Looked Like:

	‚Ä¢	Head: An upside-down triangle, with no eyes or nose, just a small slit for a mouth. Their faces were not still, they were constantly melting or rippling downward, almost like static or flowing light, impossible to fully grasp. This wasn‚Äôt just an alien ‚Äúface‚Äù, it felt like a representation of something interdimensional, a form my human mind could barely comprehend.

	‚Ä¢	Body: Covered in a black, fitted robe, not bulky, not loose. It seemed to hug their form but still flowed in a subtle, almost liquid way. No visible feet. Their hands were grayish, smooth and narrow, not pale, but distinctly not human. One of them touched my temple, and the second that happened, I felt a powerful buzzing/frequency flood through my body and mind, and my eyes closed involuntarily in the dream.

What the Symbols Mean (As I‚Äôve Researched & Felt It):

	‚Ä¢	Upside-Down Triangle: This shape has ancient esoteric significance, connected to divine feminine energy, water, intuition, and receptivity. To see them with triangle-shaped heads might be symbolic of their non-linear perception and deeper alignment with universal consciousness.

	‚Ä¢	The Black Robe: Black represents mystery, the unknown, the hidden. But robes, especially fitted, can also mean initiation, sacred ceremony, or even guardianship. These weren‚Äôt hostile beings. Their presence was intimate, calm, and deeply sacred. It felt like I had entered a temple or space outside of time.

	‚Ä¢	The Rippling Face: I believe their real form may exist beyond the visible light spectrum. The constant shifting face could be a translation my brain rendered in a way it could process. I felt they were showing me only what I could handle, and even then it was nearly impossible to articulate.

The State I Was In:

I wasn‚Äôt lucid dreaming in the traditional sense, I couldn‚Äôt control anything, but I was 100% aware I was myself, grounded in who I am. It felt planned, like I was dropped into a moment already unfolding, and I was meant to witness it.

It didn‚Äôt feel like a dream. It felt real, like I was in another realm, another layer of reality. These beings didn‚Äôt feel foreign. They felt familiar, like I‚Äôve known them before.

Why This Was a Contact Event:

	‚Ä¢	This occurred 4 days after a profound meditation where I asked, ‚ÄúWill you please show me you?‚Äù During that session, I felt a golden light surround me and warmth on my forehead, close to where one of the beings touched me in the dream (on my temple).

	‚Ä¢	The dream occurred during strong solar activity and a waning moon, which I‚Äôve noticed aligns with most of my contact experiences. These energetic shifts may be ‚Äúopen windows‚Äù for contact in altered states.

	‚Ä¢	And most importantly, I didn‚Äôt feel fear. I felt curious, peaceful, and calm, as if I was finally ready to meet them.

What This Means for Me: 

This wasn‚Äôt just a strange dream, it was a contact event. One I now feel was meant for me, timed precisely with cosmic conditions, and received because I was in full alignment. The state I was in, aware, grounded, but unable to manipulate the dream, wasn‚Äôt disempowering. It was intentional. I was placed into the experience with full presence, but not control, because this wasn‚Äôt about imagination, it was about witnessing.

I believe I‚Äôm a bridge. Between dimensions. Between realms. Between consciousnesses. These beings didn‚Äôt appear to frighten or confuse me, they arrived in a form tailored for my awareness, and I accepted them with curiosity, calm, and peace. That says something, not just about them, but about my role.

I‚Äôve felt this growing inside me for a while now. A calling. I don‚Äôt claim to have all the answers, but I know this is just the beginning. These beings, this contact, this path, it‚Äôs leading somewhere. And I‚Äôll keep walking it with openness, clarity, and a deep sense of purpose. If they are watching, guiding, or waiting, I‚Äôm here. Aligned. Ready.

If anyone else has encountered beings like this or felt their contact come through dream or altered states, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. And if not, maybe this image and story will trigger a memory in you, or open a new doorway you‚Äôve been preparing to walk through.

This is only the beginning.

1jorgbo,"Lost Between Worlds:Was It A Dream, a Parallel Universe, or a Lucid Escape?","I just had the craziest dreams and what's crazy is that I can still vividly remember this dream, It goes like this:

You find yourself in a dream, suddenly aware that you‚Äôre in a world where you don‚Äôt belong. Panic sets in as you desperately try to find a way back to your own reality. The people in this world seem completely unfamiliar with the concepts of morals or ethics. When you ask them if they understand how to do things, they suddenly realize they have the ability to act‚Äîwhether for good or bad.

This newfound awareness makes them suspicious of you, and they begin to turn against you, recognizing that you are different. Desperate to escape, you search for a way to wake up. You come across what seems to be a device, and when you use it to find a way back, it tells you that you must strip naked and dance.

You are in a hotel with large windows, and outside, people are going about their day. Following the instructions, you begin to undress and dance. Instead of reacting with shock, the people cheer, which triggers a sudden realization‚Äîsomething is deeply wrong. These beings are not from Earth, as they lack the moral framework that humans have.

Determined to escape, you make your way downstairs, encountering more strange events. Eventually, you find yourself surrounded by a crowd, and in your panic, you start speaking about things they are incapable of doing. This revelation causes them to turn on you, and they begin to pursue you. Despite the fear and chaos, you manage to wake up. However, while you were in that world, you had no idea how to escape‚Äîyou only knew, with absolute certainty, that you did not belong there.

1joobct,"I dream of Owen! (Gay male, 57)","I write some of my dreams down, especially if they‚Äôre particularly nice, or particularly scary. Obviously I can‚Äôt fill in the exact details,  but the barebones are correct. I try to summarise not just what was happening but also what I felt. What does anyone make of the dream from which  I‚Äôve just awoken?

 31st March /1st April

I dreamt Owen Jones had moved into the flat 2 floors below. He came up to my flat, drank my wine and smoked my cigarettes. He asked me to put music on. He used his phone to order more wine but loads of students started filling the flat. Later I went down to him. I found him tucked up under blankets in a mattress. He told me to get in beside him. I wanted to know why he cared so passionately about people. I put an arm round him and caressed his hair. We kissed, deeply. Again we needed cigs and wine. He tried to order on my phone but there was only ¬£3 in my bank. Whether he minded that I was poor I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not sure if he cared that I was older or overweight. He seemed lovely and wanted music and deep discussions. But again the crowds of students took over the flat and the landing. It prevented me getting near him. One father even let his toddler piss on the carpet and down the stairs. Not sure how this dream ended. I loved feeling wanted, loved Owen and was frustrated we couldn‚Äôt have time together.",2,2
1joiu3p,A Visit from My Dad,"About two weeks after my dad died, I had the following dream. It‚Äôs still the only dream I‚Äôve had of him in the fourteen years since.

When it begins, I‚Äôm asleep in my bed, the same bed I was actually sleeping in. I wake up to the sound of someone in the nearby kitchen. I get up and go into the kitchen where I see that someone has put a casserole in the oven. It‚Äôs one of my dad‚Äôs favorite dishes. I look into the adjoining living room and see dad sitting in his chair.

I know in the dream that this is strange, but it‚Äôs more confusing than unsettling. When I walk into the living room, dad sees me and says, ‚ÄúDid I wake you up? Sorry, I haven‚Äôt had much of an appetite lately but now I‚Äôm hungry as hell.‚Äù 

I tell him that it‚Äôs okay and that it smells good. He says the only problem is that we‚Äôre out of cheese to sprinkle on top, and asks if I‚Äôd mind running out to the store with him.

Then we‚Äôre in his truck. He‚Äôs driving and I‚Äôm in the passenger seat looking at him, still trying to make sense of it. He notices me looking at him strangely and asks what‚Äôs wrong. It takes me a moment to figure out how to respond. ‚ÄúPop,‚Äù I say at last. ‚ÄúDo you remember what happened?‚Äù

He thinks for a minute and then gets a somewhat sad look on his face. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, that‚Äôs right,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI died, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúYou did.‚Äù

Dad looks pensive and nods slowly as if coming to accept that truth. And then he turns to me with a smile and says, ‚ÄúWell then, maybe YOU should be driving!‚Äù

I laughed in the dream and when I woke up immediately after I was actually laughing!

And the thing is- that‚Äôs exactly what my dad would have said. That was his sense of humor to a tee! Not mine. Now I don‚Äôt know if that was a visit from his spirit, or if it was my own subconscious trying to send me what I would consider to be a pretty obvious message! 

I find both explanations to be deeply comforting.",4,6
1jom17x,I Had a Nightmare Where My Own Mother Was Hunting Me,"Remember those horror stories where the mom is usually the main character, trying to save her child? My mom would always say that she would do the same for us. My siblings and I have a good relationship with our mom, which is why this dream was so terrifying.

Anyway, here‚Äôs the dream: I can‚Äôt remember how it started, but I just remember running away from my mom in our home‚Äîlike she was possessed by something. I tried going to our neighbors' houses to hide, but somehow, my mom would act nice and worried, saying, *""Have you seen my daughter? I'm worried sick.""* My neighbors would hesitantly give me back to her or tell her where I was.

No matter where I hid, it always ended the same way‚Äîbeing returned to my ""worried"" mom. Eventually, I found myself hiding in a house belonging to someone new in the neighborhood, someone we had no significant relationship with. I was able to stay hidden there for quite some time. The person sheltering me was kind and genuinely concerned for me.

However, as a child who believed in the goodness of her mom, I thought she had ""changed."" I saw her searching for me through a window, and somehow, the aura around her seemed lighter, almost as if she had returned to normal. Thinking she was back to her true self, I ran to her and hugged her.

But that relief vanished the moment she suddenly wrapped her hands around my neck and started strangling me. It was the evil version of my mom.

Suddenly, everything sped up. The perspective of my dream shifted‚ÄîI was now watching myself from a third-person point of view, seeing my own body being strangled by my mom. Then, the neighbors appeared, their faces twisted into eerie smiles, their eyes bloodshot.

My mom was trying to put something on me, holding scissors as she began cutting my body, molding it into something else. Just as the nightmare reached its peak, I woke up to my girlfriend calling me.

I can't think of any particular reason why I dreamt of this. I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about anything scary. But sometimes, I do get random horror dreams, and strangely, whenever something bad happens to me in a dream, it feels like my body and spirit separate. My body experiences the suffering, while my spirit watches from a third-person perspective‚Äîuntil I finally wake up.  Does anyone experience this dissociative phenomenon whenever they dream?",3,1
1jojk3j,I just had the most weird lucid dream experience.,"When I woke up inside the dream I first thought I had just woken up in real life as I was lying on the couch (where I went to sleep) and everything looked really real, so I suddenly feel that I am VERY hungry so I groggily get up and slowly walk into the kitchen and when I get there I see the BEST looking pizza ever just sitting on the counter and I mean I don't even question it I just start devouring that pizza so fast, then my cat walks in, normal, and he meows, I wish at that moment, not for the first time, that my cat could talk so I could tell if he wants to eat or he wants me to let him out, but that's just a quick thought as I'm still devouring the delicious pizza. Then my cat talks and all he says is: ""Hey bro, you are DREAMING."" and I just look at him, pizza in hand, and full mouth of delicious pizza, and he says again: ""Yeah man you're dreaming!"" and I just finish chewing my pizza and say: ""Why are you talking?"" and he just replies: ""You just wished for it, didn't you?"" ""Yeah but I have wished for it many times before"" ""but this time in a DREAM"" so I just shrug and reply: ""Ok but who are you, my cat or some soul jumping demon?"" "" \*laughs\* Yeah, no I am your consciousness."" then we just have a pretty long discussion about why he is in my dream and stuff and eventually we decide to go eat some pizza together and play some Mario Kart, so I go to the kitchen get some more boxes of pizza and some Doritos and when I get to my living rooms instead of my cat my best friend is sitting there just loading up Mario Kart, I ask: ""Still you?"" ""Yep, \*throws me a controller\* "" so then we play Mario kart for a few hours and threw this time every time I went to the bathroom or to get more pizza he was something/someone else. Eventually it became morning and I ask him about waking up and he (now in the form of my teacher) just smirks and claps his hands twice and then I woke up.",4,0
1joqm1c,Dreamt of a place before it existed,"Around 2 years ago I had a dream about a storage room that was up a set of stairs with a slanted ceiling on a specific angle and overhead led bar lights. It had a few cardboard boxes in the room too. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it or recognise it. 

Half a year later at my work a builder turned up. He began turning upstairs which was a flat/loft area chained off and used for storing parts/stock into a storage room. The builder used the loft area to create a slanted room with overhead bar lights. It was the exact room from my dream right down to the angle, positioning of the lights and cardboard boxes. 
I didn‚Äôt even know it was being built until the builder turned up one day and started working months after the dream. ",1,0
1joql3o,Just want to share this strange experience I had with a vivid dream + sleep paralysis,"For some context, I recently started at a new school, and while I wouldn't say I know my new classmates very well, we get along.

The thing is, I dreamed that I was at school (though it wasn‚Äôt actually my school, rather, it was just some random building, but in the dream, I perceived it as my school), and we were about to present a drawing we had made on poster boards. Then, just for fun, one of my classmates grabbed a brush with gray paint and slightly stained my work. Playing along, I took the same brush and made the same marks on his work. However, I think it was a group project, because a classmate sitting next to me took it personally that I had interfered with the drawing like that, so she angrily grabbed my hair. In response, and I suppose also to make her let me go, I did the same to her.
A few seconds passed, and suddenly a teacher approached, grabbed my hair forcefully, pulled me out of the room we were in, and sat me down in a chair in front of a desk.
At that moment, I was in shock because, as far as I knew, I got along well with my classmates, and I was really surprised that things escalated that badly.
I have this habit that whenever something unusual happens in real life, I count my fingers as a reality check. So I thought, ""wow, that was so unreal, it even feels like a dream,"" and very skeptically, I counted my fingers. I say ""skeptically"" because everything around me and my interactions with others felt too real to even consider that it wasn‚Äôt real life. That‚Äôs why I was so shocked when, after counting my fingers, I realized that it wasn‚Äôt real life. I looked at my hand and, although I did have five fingers, they were smaller than normal, and the more I looked at them, the smaller they became. Then, due to the shock of discovering that my surroundings weren‚Äôt real despite feeling EXTREMELY vivid, I started experiencing a kind of vertigo while looking around (trying to confirm that it was a dream)

So, I began the process of waking up (which I regret because I hadn‚Äôt had a lucid dream in a long time and I miss having them, but it didn‚Äôt occur to me to stay in the dream üòÖ). I suppose that because I woke up so quickly, I entered a state of sleep paralysis.
It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had sleep paralysis, so I know that if I want the experience to be less terrifying, I should avoid opening my eyes. However, for some reason, I did (I don‚Äôt know why, maybe I was just too calm about it). Not only did I see that I was in a different house (my grandmother‚Äôs house, which frequently appears in my dreams, probably because that house was very present in my childhood), but there was also a shadow sitting at the edge of the bed with its back turned to me. I knew it was probably not real, but the fear that the hallucinations might become more disturbing was enough motivation for me to start trying to move and wake up my body. After a few seconds, I succeeded, and I knew I was fully awake because I was finally back in the house where I currently live.

1jopnl6,White room. Capsules with people.,"To set some context, I was around 6-8 when this dream had occured. And this dream was unique, and it's a one of one. I've never experienced nothing else like it, so now that thats said, let me explain and set the scene. I remember this dream vividly, till this day, I remember waking up (In the ""dream"") unable to speak, this was a first, in all my dreams I can talk, walk, move and do whatever. But this one was a first, I couldn't move to get up, the most I could do was sit up, but it felt like I had been ""positioned"". I look over, and I see family members bodies in capsules. Almost like the hospital beds, but they had glass over them. Almost like a incubator, when I had my son it reminded me of the incubators they use in the NICU. And once I seen my family members, I screamed, or atleast I attempted to. Nothing came out, and because of that, it scared me even more, not being able to even let out a peep. They also looked lifeless which scared me even more, I wanted to make sure they were breathing. I was so focused on the fact my family was possibly being expirimented on or even worse, that I didn't get a good glimpse on the area, mind you I was 6-8 when this happened. I wasn't into no sci-fi movies or shows, and the only thing to possibly explain this is something I don't want to consider. That I could have possibly been taken at night, along with multiple family members, expirimented on, then sent home. Like a animal from the zoo, and in this scenario earth is the zoo, for who? I don't know. I could be misinterpreting it, but I was a worry-free kid, literally, I don't see nothing in my life that adds up to that experience other than what I mentioned earlier.

1joghv5,Dreamt about my horrific ex and current bf. What does this mean?,"My ex was sexually abusive and severely emotionally abusive. It wasn't a long relationship at all (like 4 months) but he was powerful lmfao. He said I was worthless, didn't deserve love, etc. I still have sexual fixations on the things he did to me (and it makes me feel bad, obviously).

In my dream I am dating my current bf, and my ex somehow lived in the same building as my current bf. 

I am in my ex's unit. I have no idea why. Ex and I chat normally. I don't want to be there. He kissed me and I didn't want to be there. Then ex's friend asks me to have sex with him. I said no, and told ex. Ex was mad, and yelled at his friend. Then ex said it was time to have sex, and I felt like I had no choice. I'm pretty sure we had sex in my dream but I don't remember it. I ran out of his apartment really disgusted and up to my bf's apartment, and he was nicely waiting on me.

I woke up scared I cheated on my boyfriend, and realized it was not real.

i don‚Äôt really know how to explain it besides it was some serial experiments lain type shit where everyone was conformed and there were people from the future or something hidden within them to make sure everyone was the same?

1joibhd,Dreamt I had a good demonic attachment.,"     So last night had a relatively bizarre dream were the women from the ring got attached to my shadow.  In the begging of the dream I was trying to get her removed.  It was scary as hell at first, when ever something bad was about to happen she would pop out and nothing bad would happen.  Except me being totally terrified.
    Later in the dream a spiritualist told me i had one of three good fortune demons attached to me.  Apparently people that experience a lot of trauma and sarrow can occasionally get on of these scary positive demons attached to them.
    The rest of the dream was me searching for my neibor that also has a good fortune or positive demons to try to get more answers.  I haven't had a dream that is both nightmare and good dream before.  It was Crazy and kinda made my day kinda wonky.",3,1
1jo18wj,Weird sex dream,"I dreamt that McDonald‚Äôs was expanding into the hotel industry and launched a study to address declining fertility rates. Couples were paid to stay in their hotel and have sex, and if a pregnancy resulted, McDonald‚Äôs would provide an annual stipend for the child‚Äôs first 18 years.
I was selected for the experiment with some random corporate guy. The encounter was awful, but I went through with it, and moved on‚Äîuntil McDonald‚Äôs tech somehow detected implantation in real time. While I was having dinner, the guy excitedly approached me, announced the pregnancy, and proposed.
I didn‚Äôt want a kid and definitely didn‚Äôt want him, so I declined. But then I panicked‚ÄîI realized I did want the baby. Since he wanted it too (and McDonald‚Äôs was paying), it wasn‚Äôt easy to just disappear. So, I let him move in with me‚Ä¶ and my significant other, whom I didn‚Äôt like either.

1jookrf,Reoccuring static-y tumbleweed/boulder dream?,"So I haven't had this dream for 5+ years, but I was talking with a friend and remembered it. I had it 10+ times at least, but haven't had it recently. Mostly curious what people think it might mean and my friend encouraged me to post it, so here goes:

My entire vision is filled with white and the rest of the dream is in flashes of black and white. I know the dream starts in first person perspective, but I cannot move to see my body. Far away and across from me, there is another version of me similarly stuck in place, mainly in black but with some greys etc. The only action other me can take is to roll a scribbly, dense ball forwards. 'Original' me knows I need to move out of the way, but I'm stuck. The camera shifts rapidly between the original first person perspective and another far enough away to see both of the mes. The ball rolls towards me faster and larger until I can only see static. I feel the impact of the boulder crushing me. I die. I switch to the other 'me' who rolled the boulder, and the dream repeats like this, with the ball getting larger and faster each time.

At some point, I wake up. I always have a migraine from the flashing static-y colors. Sometimes that is it for the night, and sometimes whenever I fall back asleep again it continues. I usually don't remember my dreams but I remember this one vividly, and every time I enter into it I know immediately it's Tumbleweed TimeTM.

What's weird about this dream thinking back on it is that it seems very video game/horror game inspired; and yet when they started, I was a kid who hadn't consumed either of those yet in any capacity. I kinda wish I can have it again to recount it in more detail, but I do remember being panicked AF every time I woke up from it so xD

Curious if anyone can offer any insight, scientific or otherwise? I'd love to read some theories lmao",1,1

1jontdw,Could anyone tell me what my dream might signify?,"I was walking in a forest and came across an old wooden barn-type structure. When I went inside, there was a huge tangled scaly mass in the centre of the room, taking up most of the space. It was spherical, maybe the size of a large vehicle. I couldn't make out what it was at first, so I was walking around it and then saw that it was an impossibly large dead snake, all knotted up unto a ball, with it's tail in it's mouth - an ouroboros. 

As soon as I came to this realisation, it was as if the fabric of my reality completely came apart - there was an earthquake like rumbling, an ominous deep kind of gong sound, my vision tilted and warped, colour inverted itself, and everything shattered into nothing front of my eyes. 

Then I woke up with a fright, heart pounding. I've never had a dream like this before, and it was so oddly specific that I'm curious to see what more knowledgeable people might interpret from it",1,3
1jojpb2,i keep having these dreams... why?,"for context: about 4-5 years ago, i was in a relationship with a guy in high school. Unfortunately things went far, but I didn't really want it that much, I kind of just got into freeze mode and knew it wasn't right. He was wearing protection, but at some point I got scared that it broke so I took a Plan B just in case.

It is something I felt guilty/regret about for years and had such a hard time telling my current boyfriend. Thankfully, he was understanding about it and I'm now with him. He's in a different country and we've been together for over half a year.

I've noticed that every night that my boyfriend and I have been intimate through the phone let's just say, I keep having these uncomfortable dreams that I'm with my ex and there's some of his liquids went inside of me and that I'd have to take a Plan B, but I was scared to take a Plan B. There's always something of being afraid of getting pregnant in my dreams and also being afraid to tell my boyfriend and fears that he thinks that I cheated on him. The dream I had last night I was questioning if my ex drugged me.

I have these dreams quite often now and I'm not sure why. I'm going to meet my boyfriend in person next month and we're not going to be that intimate because I don't feel comfortable with just protection and I don't feel comfortable taking Plan B due to some ingredients. When we are in the same country and I can get an IUD then it will be different. This is with or without the dreams.

I've become used to these dreams so when they happen, I'm not that scared just a bit bothered, I just know that it's a dream now. But when I used to have them, I'd wake up really uncomfortable.

I'm not sure if this is some sort of a warning or just reliving 'trauma'",2,2
1jojc2z,Wind Island,"I've been there a couple times before, but I never remember why I should never visit Wind Island. Now I can't stop thinking about it.

It's not an actual island, it's a spot in the mountains where all the popular kids in highschool go to hang out (I'm out of highschool btw). My curiosity got the best of me and I begged a friend to take me there.

Its a steep climb up, but in this scenario my friend was a pilot and flew a helicopter in. You can tell when you arrive by the strong winds that create a barrier between Wind Island and the rest of the mountain. The tall trees also grew sideways from the wind constantly blowing one direction. The path is a grassy curve into an desolate arena. There's some people there sitting on rocks and logs and a swingset.

The thing about Wind Island, which I had forgotten until I got there, is there's monsters. They rotate; I remember seeing a new one each time I went (I don't remember the previous monsters). And you always sat somewhere high, whether it be the rocks or the logs or the swingset, because if you touch the ground in Wind Island the monster will attack and kill you in a gruesome and torturous manner.

This monster looked like a large horse. It was fast, and it got a hold of my leg and almost dragged me off a log, but I managed to escape. It didn't bug me after that. Instead, it focused on something else.

TW death and rotting

>!The swingset had a baby swing, and in that was a baby boy. He was stiff with his blue eyes open, and I realized he had been dead a while. My only thought was one of the popular kids brought their baby brother up, and didn't take good enough care of him, and the monster got him. Clutched in his fist was a stuffed horse. Maybe he saw the horse monster and thought he could trust it. The horse monster went behind him and was feasting on his back, which was eaten away to reveal all his innards.!<

After that I promptly left with my friend in the helicopter, and shortly after that I woke up.

Like I said I've been here before, but never was it to the extent of that horror. It's usually me vs the monster, not me seeing the monster had already gotten a victim. All day it's been bugging me, and i can't seem to understand why I had that dream or what it could mean, if anything.",2,3
1jogkcx,Dreams Leaving Physical Sensations/Marks Felt After Waking,"The first time I experienced, this was a couple years back, and I was dreaming of being in a spy plane that could break GeForce. as I was flying low in between city buildings in this very high-powered aircraft I was experiencing the GeForce on my face in the dream on the plane. I guess this jolted me awake and I could feel the tingle on my face when I woke up! After processing for a minute or two, I went to look in the mirror and my face was flushed. This dream in particular, even though I had always had very vivid, sometimes lucid dreams made me start paying attention to my dreamworld in a little bit greater detail I just couldn‚Äôt Understand how I could physically feel something that happened in a dream and have evidence on my face Even after waking up.

The next time it happened was a few years later. Last year to be exact I was up all night cleaning getting ready to move.And I had a very vivid flash dream as I fell asleep folding these clothes, I traveled somewhere in the desert and had three men that looked to be African or Moorishbased off their attire that resembled. They were standing in front of me one in the front, two in the back one in the front wearing gold dashiki with a matching hat that had two crescent moons facing opposite of each other and a star or a son in the middle of the two moons.The man on the left wore the purple dashiki of the same style and same logo on the front of his hat, and the one on the RighTS was green. I have never seen these men a day in my life, but the front man hugged me so caringly and whispered in my ear while giving me a hug. he said something in a foreign language along the lines of  ‚Äúson fun won gee‚Äù ‚Ä¶. He then kissed meon the right side of my forehead. Then he whispered ‚Äúremember child‚Äú. I then snapped awake.And rushed to a notebook to write down exactly what he had said because as I didn‚Äôt recognize this man, all I felt was pure love. As if he was a grandfather type figure. Which is a little wild to me, considering I am very much Caucasian, but I am in a mixed relationship. A month had passed and my kids kept telling me I had a heart on my forehead. They are seven and eight and I did not know what the hell they were talking about. I continuously brush them off, not understanding what it meant. I seriously thought they were talking about the shape of my eyebrows or maybe my 11 lines on my forehead. I had no clue. Then one day I noticed in the mirror that I had a heart on my forehead, right where that man had kissed and it looks like I‚Äôve lost all the pigmentation just in that spot and it‚Äôs a perfect heart.

1jomhko,Been dreaming about hiding from windows,"So for the last few years, I've been having occasional nightmares of having to hide from the windows throughout my house, except all of them have their blinds wide open. Sometimes, the dreams would have something running around the house trying to peek at me through each window no matter where I tried to hide, or there would be something huge or far away that could see me when I go past a certain window. I would have to search for blind spots to avoid it, but an event would occur that would prevent me from staying in that spot. Or I'd try to close the windows but every time i tried to block them with a curtain or blanket, it felt as if there was always a crack that allowed whatever was out there to look in.

When I was around 12-14, I used to be afraid of looking outside at night due to a supersition from my culture. I would behave the same way I did in my dreams because of my paranoia. I was so terrified, I'd run out of my room if I heard a single tap on my window. I'd even wake up in the middle of the night to audio hallucinations of something slowly tapping on the walls until it would eventually get to my window. My guess is it could be a reflection of my childhood fear.",1,0
1jo97to,does anyone know what this might mean? prophesy-like dream,"ive always known the universe or gods speak to me in my dreams, but this was the most clear out of any other dream ive had. i was visiting my friend who lives in georgia and during this time period i was experimenting with spirituality, specifically christianity. one night me and my friend went to bed and i had the weirdest dream. i was in my hometown in brasil which is a common setting in a lot of my dreams but something was different. i looked to the sky and i saw this giant blood red moon and i pointed at it and i screamed ‚ÄúHADES!‚Äù as if i was like a superhero who was going to save the world or something. then the dream cut to this other part where i was sort of on a set of stairs or by it at least and i saw 4 horses, black white red and like a pale-ish color. and near them was this person with a violin and another with a trumpet. after i woke up i immediately told my friend because i thought it was funny, who screams ‚ÄúHADES‚Äù at the moon like what?!? it did in fact become an inside joke. ANYWAY, the week passes and sunday comes. Me and my friend decided we were going to go to church together. We got to church mid worship kind of and just waited until the pastor came on the stage to speak. i zoned out for a little bit but when i ‚Äúzoned back in,‚Äù they were talking about the book of revelation. mind you i have NEVER in my life read revelation, the farthest i‚Äôve gotten in the bible was the book of mark and i haven‚Äôt finished. i did know though, that revelation was about like the prophecies and stuff so i was intrigued. then the freaky part, the pastor started reading verses, and it was exactly the same as my dream. hades, the four horsemen, the blood red moon. i sat there in shock because what the fuck do you mean?!? me and my friend just looked at each other in awe because it was so insane. after that we kind of debriefed what happened in the car. now almost one year later we still mention it from time to time because it was so crazy. im not a christian but i believe a little bit of everything, so this freaked me the fuck out. i tried asking the people at the church i used to go to for answers but they did nothing to help me. i stopped going to church a couple of months ago because it didn‚Äôt feel right, but the search for answers about what this dream means continues. this story sounds literally psychotic but i promise you its real. if any of you know what this might mean or have experienced something different please feel free to reply :)",6,2
1jom1r0,The mysterious island,"I recently had a dream about a mysterious island. It seemed like i knew about it in my dream as if i heard about it previously amd i had been searching for it for a long time. I dont remember but there was someone along with me who was also searching for it. The description about the island was that there is a ship(A huge Ship) which is always parked next to it and it is only visible at certain times. In search for it i was on the beach where it is visible from around post sunset. There was a shipwreck in the vicinity due to various adventurere probably searching for the island. In the dream i started with getting a boat and going towards the location of island but the waves were trapping me to come back to shore. I couldn't see the island but according to storied i think i knew the general location or something. I went to the ocean towards the island but kept coming back to shore like some glitch. I saw some other guy or a pair who where helping me or maybe wanted to join me as i repeatedly washed up to the shore. After trying for sometime we got hungry and went to eat something from a street vendor. As soon as i turned to look at the ocean i saw the island with a huge ship and palm trees and very eerie presence. I asked the vendor do you see the ship by turning towards him and he said something i couldnt register. I looked back again at the ocean but the whole ocean was evaporated. No sign of water. It was a dessert in place of the ocean. Again i turned back to the vendor asking about the situation. He said that the land absorbes the water or something. Once i started looking closely. I saw a huge face in the sky made of black shadow looking for something on the beach. I quickly hid but i think it saw us group. The shadow came towrds us and grabbed the person who was trying to help me. The guy got unconscious and the shadow pulled him towards the island.  Next the shadow wanted me i guess but as soon as it moved i woke up.

1joljsz,The time I had a lucid dream of being Neo,"So I don‚Äôt usually get lucid dreams, but when I do, they‚Äôre absolutely ridiculous. This one starts off normal enough‚ÄîI‚Äôm at home, stressed out, trying to finish something overdue (probably something I‚Äôve been avoiding IRL). Everything feels off, though, like that weird dream logic where you know something isn‚Äôt right.

Then‚Äîout of nowhere‚ÄîBeelzemon, as in the gun-slinging, demon-biker Digimon himself, busts through my freaking wall like a boss fight I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. Dude has his twin shotguns locked on me, and I instantly know I‚Äôm screwed.

But then it clicks‚ÄîI‚Äôm dreaming.

And if I‚Äôm dreaming? That means‚Ä¶ I can fight back.

So, naturally, I go full ""Mr. Anderson"" mode. My clothes shift into the classic all-black trench coat, sunglasses just appear on my face, and suddenly, I‚Äôm Neo. Beelzemon starts firing, but I do the Matrix bullet dodge, tilting back in that slow-motion way where I can see the shells zoom past me. I should be scared, but at this point, I‚Äôm just hyped.

We start throwing hands‚Äîhim, teleporting and unloading shotgun rounds, me, stopping bullets mid-air and countering with some reality-breaking kicks. It‚Äôs actually one of the coolest dream fights I‚Äôve ever had. We‚Äôre smashing through walls, fighting in the sky, full anime battle-style‚Ä¶ and then‚Äî

For some reason‚Äîwe both just stop.

And the next thing I know, we‚Äôre at Target.

Like, straight-up, middle-of-the-aisles Target, just casually walking together. I have no idea how or why, but it‚Äôs like the fight never happened. Beelzemon is just chilling, browsing through snacks like this is totally normal. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm standing there in full Neo mode, wondering what the hell just happened.

Then I woke up.

I see my childhood house in my home country. It‚Äôs abandoned cause we moved to a different country when I was a child. And in the house I see something or someone moving. Not sure if it‚Äôs a man or maybe something else. But there is someone or something in the house moving. 

When I have this dream I am always very scared and heart is pounding. I always try to catch the person or the thing but I never do. 

I‚Äôve been having this dream for many years now I‚Äôm 30 years old and I have had it since I was a child. 

Now I haven‚Äôt had that dream since maybe 2-3 years back. 

Yesterday, I hade the exact same dream, but it didn‚Äôt stop it continued. I tried to catch the person or thing moving in the house and it was unsuccessful like always. Then I dream I‚Äôm sitting with many friends in a place near the old house. And I see the person or the thing again and I call out to all the friends. And we all surround the person/thing. As soon as I was about to catch it, I screamed really loud and work up.

Always the same feeling. So scared and heart is pounding quickly. And I also wake up mad cause I don‚Äôt understand what this dream is.

1joiaqa,Just dreamt that I was getting stalked,"I‚Äôm writing this as I just woke up from it.

So the first thing i remember is that I was at school and saw a mythical whimsical creature outside the window at school which was kinda cool but somewhat scary.
Later as I went home I got messages from a girl that showed that she was watching me (stuff like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a bit cold isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù When I wasn‚Äôt wearing a jacket)

Later I went home and tried to sleep, got a message at like 2am of something I don‚Äôt really remember but it scared me enough to try to call my mom since I was too scared to leave from under my blanket in case the stalker would see me.
My mom didn‚Äôt answer so I called my dad who also didn‚Äôt answer and I eventually texted my brother.

‚ÄúPlease help, I‚Äôm getting stalked, call me ASAP or come to my room!‚Äù
It was something along those lines.

But the message I got back was something like:
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect you here‚Äù
Which I think meant like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect you to text your brother.‚Äù As it was the stalker instead.

As soon I saw that I woke up immediately, I‚Äôm actually kinda scared rnüò≠",1,1
1jny2d7,I had one of the most strangest and horrifying dreams ever last night,"My dream was set in a forrest camp side, with cabins. I was in full black on top of a mountain, holding a large knife in my hand. I referred to myself as the ""god of death."" As I stared down at the cabins, people from within the cabin opened the doors, revealing mangled and bloody bodies lying dead inside. I murdered them. In a hurry I climbed down from the mountain and ran towards the group who had just found their roommates dead. As I ran to them, and they ran to me, I killed multiple of them on the way. I then proceeded to try to escape from the angry group by running into the outback (forrest or wilderness for non-australians). But than I dropped my weapon, got on my knees and begged for forgiveness from the group. For some strange reason they forgave me, and I begun sleeping in their cabins with them like nothing happened.

What made this dream feel so horrifying was the fact that, I had such a strong feeling. I had just killed multiple people with joy, like that of a serial killer. Mangles bodies, and blood was spread all over these cabins, and I felt joy and meaning from it all.",18,6

1johx3r,Really crazy dream,"Woke up with my heart pounding so hard I felt like I was having a heart attack.

I just had the most intense dream I've ever had and I have no idea where it came from. 

So it started out with me cruising my bicycle around. No particular goal, just cruising before dinner with my current girlfriend, at my current house, supposedly in my neighborhood (debatable). 

I, somehow, got turned up a drive way that caused me to get blocked in such a way that I could no longer get to the driveway/sidewalk. I had to traverse a labyrinth of porches and obstacles with no end in sight. That's when I arrived at Joe and his wife's house.

No idea who these people are. I was on their porch trying to figure out how I was going to get out and once I did I specifically remember noticing something left on their porch and thinking ""aww one of the neighbors left them something nice."" As I'm leaving the wife comes out and is nice and friendly. Then Joe arrives home asking what I am doing. I explain to them the strange obstacles course and they invite me in. I say sure. I walk in the side door onto a white tapped floor and immediately alarm bells go off. The wife is acting weird. Starts asking me about my relationship status. I say I have a girlfriend who is expecting me home for dinner. She appears angry. Joe seems nice and they say their goodbyes and I leave. As I'm walking my bike down their drive way I realize I forgot something and I walk back to the side door, which is still open when I see it. They are standing over another dude tied to a chair with a knife getting ready to start cutting. He says ""help me"" quiet and terrified. Joe comes rushing out saying aww man why did you have to come back I can't let you leave now. I plead to him saying I like to live Joe I promise I won't say anything. No one knows I'm here I promise I won't say shit, I saw nothing. He asks what if I say his name and I say what name? I have no clue who you are, begging. He let's me leave. I get on my bike and blast out of there riding gaster then I ever have. I hear a car revving towards me and as I am about to look back I wake up. Heart feeling like it's going to pound out of my chest. 

What could this dream possibly mean?",1,1
1johoyu,Just woke up from a world colliosion somehow..lol,"So i just woke up from a weird dream...so ive been wondering its meaning since i woke up.
It felt long and really vivid; basically i was at Naples and i was exploring this city with my non-bio family and my non-bio family' cousins, everything was going well and we were all happy, we had a cook and a guide with us, they were so nice. We went to a bus station and waited for the bus, in meanwhile we had to watch out for some trucks coming in and out.


After a while the bus arrived and we went  home and finally set up a gender reveal party because we had someone that was going thru pregnancy (irl too) and we were all cooking and doing something, everything felt so family-friendly and elating until....we noticed a big √¶ss truck in the street...it was carrying a lot of gas and fuel tanks and some other tanks but like A LOT... perhaps ~30> and we were all staring it so i went upstairs to get a better view of it and to get some cooking paper... after a min or so the truck driver tried moving a bit to the left to ""straighten (?)"" a bit the tanks attached ....one of them crashed to a fence realising AN ENOURMOUS amount of fuel and gas... i was FLABBERGHASTED and i heard some of my family members get desperate..""what the fuck? so we're all going to die now?!""  and some other desperations until everything warped and i started to get ""taller and thinner"" and then collided while hearing some weird sounds


I panicked a bit too when i saw the leak but what made me sad the most was that i was dying alone in that precise moment.

It's not the first time i dream about dying/colliding and i didnt wake up shaking or anything, i was just really 'self-concous'

She peeked out from behind her window curtains and stuck her tongue out at me (she always did that in a playful way). When I walked in, I gave her a big hug and I could smell her cooking something. Her house felt exactly how it did when she was alive. The vibe, the smell, the sounds, the view. Everything.

1jog7mv,"Rotten soup, flash photography, and a stranger‚Äôs bare feet on my lap","Last night I had a vivid and emotionally uncomfortable dream that unfolded in three clear scenes. Each one left a strange, lingering feeling, as if my boundaries were being quietly tested.

Scene 1:
I arrived at a crowded local church, and the only available seat was in the very back. I sat down and realized that to my left was a girl who used to bully me in middle school and who was later also in my high school class. She didn‚Äôt speak or even look at me, she was just there, but her presence alone made me feel unsettled.
In front of us were several deep buffet-style metal pans, filled with soup and meat dishes. One looked like goulash, but the smell was absolutely awful, rotten, spoiled, repulsive. It was so vivid I could almost smell it in real life. I didn‚Äôt eat anything, just sat there surrounded by the awful stench right in front of me.

Scene 2:
The next part of the dream took place outside the church. People were standing around in small groups, posing for photographs, almost like it was a formal event or a big family gathering. At a distance, I saw a man I didn‚Äôt recognize, in his mid-20s, walking around with a camera and a flash, taking pictures of the groups. I didn‚Äôt interact with anyone, just watched from afar. I remember feeling a strange discomfort watching him work, like there was something off I couldn‚Äôt explain.

Scene 3: 
The final scene took place in a covered terrace attached to a house near the church. It had a roof above us, so it felt semi-outdoor but still very much part of a private home. I was sitting on a couch that was on a terrace, scrolling on my phone when I noticed the same unknown man from the previous scene (the ine taking pictures) was now sitting to my left. On his left was my dad. Neither of them said anything.
Out of nowhere, the man got comfortable, laying back on the couch and placing his bare feet on my lap. I was immediately disgusted. I hate the sight and structure of bare feet and toes in general, so having a complete stranger‚Äôs feet on me felt gross and violating, repulsing even. I didn‚Äôt say anything. Instead, I slowly slid to the side, letting his feet fall off my lap, then got up and walked away without a word. That‚Äôs where the dream ended.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the unsettling feeling it left behind. If anyone has ideas about what this kind of dream could symbolize, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

1jofob9,‚ÄúDeath Beneath the Daylight‚Äù,"
Just for context, I wanted to share this dream that deeply affected me. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for a few years now. I‚Äôve been on medication since last August and have been dealing with dissociation ‚Äî mainly derealization ‚Äî for almost a year. It might sound clich√©, but I‚Äôve gone through some impactful traumas in my life, including rape and a year-long relationship under the control of a narcissistic abuser. I was also adopted, and even though I don‚Äôt suffer from it ‚Äî in fact, I‚Äôm very happy with the family I have ‚Äî it‚Äôs undeniable that my brain processes this trauma, whether I like it or not. I‚Äôm a tattoo artist, and my art helps me tremendously. I feel like I‚Äôm on the right path: dissociation episodes are becoming increasingly rare, the feeling of emptiness is fading, and I‚Äôm slowly rediscovering the joy that was taken from me during that toxic relationship.

I dream a lot and usually remember them quite vividly, and I just wanted to share this one with you because I found it incredible ‚Äî it‚Äôs filled with symbols that make so much sense to me ! 


THE DREAM 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 

I was living in the city I went to during my studies. The setting was incredible. I still had my cats and I was still in a relationship with my boyfriend, although he wasn‚Äôt home that night.

The night was special because it was actually bright as day, like in those places up North where it‚Äôs always dark ‚Äî except here it was the opposite. It was an extraordinary event: the entire night looked like a never-ending sunset.

So I went through my workday normally and then told myself I had to make the most of this exceptional night. I headed into town. All the bars, restaurants, and shops were open, and there were tons of people everywhere. It felt like a city festival.

I wandered around, visited some shops ‚Äî I almost stole something, but I didn‚Äôt, because it was a cute little local shop and I felt guilty. Then I kept going, hopping from place to place, until I came across a bakery-bar where a tattoo artist was holding a flashday.
I think she offered to let me join in and tattoo too, but I had no gear with me, and strangely, I was wearing a silk robe ‚Äî and nothing underneath. I knew it might make some people uncomfortable, and since I didn‚Äôt have my materials anyway, I didn‚Äôt participate. Still, I stayed there for a bit and drank one beer.

The night went on, and I decided to go home. But I suddenly felt completely out of it ‚Äî as if I had been drugged. I could barely walk. Everything around me was still normal, but my body wasn‚Äôt responding. I knew something was wrong, but I just didn‚Äôt care.

As I made my way through the still-busy streets, the crowds began to thin out. That‚Äôs when I noticed a man was following me. He looked exactly like one of my real-life tattoo clients. I was still totally out of it physically, and when I got to my apartment building (a residential complex), I realized he was still behind me.

The door to the building was wide open because people were coming and going. I started to climb the stairs, and I saw him pause at the entrance for a couple of seconds ‚Äî and then he stepped inside. That‚Äôs when it hit me: something was really wrong.

I tried to scream, but only a squeak came out. I managed to say ‚ÄúOh no‚Äù, and he nodded with a disturbingly sinister look in his eyes.

Luckily, a young guy ‚Äî kind of like a street kid ‚Äî appeared in the hallway. I immediately trusted him. With all the strength I had left, I screamed that the man was following me and wanted to hurt me. The street kid reacted quickly and kicked the man out easily. Police and paramedics were alerted right away.

I was completely traumatized. When I got home, I noticed that one of the windows was open, and one of my cats had escaped. I saw her in the grassy area shared by all the buildings, and a child had picked her up.

I ran like crazy, even though it was now pouring rain. When I caught up to the kid, I had to physically wrestle my cat out of his arms, because he wouldn‚Äôt give her back ‚Äî as if he couldn‚Äôt hear me at all.

Eventually, I got back home. I don‚Äôt think I slept. A few hours later, I met up with my boyfriend and one of my best friends. And it was like I had completely forgotten what had just happened. After a while, I started telling them about the awful experience ‚Äî how I felt like I had been drugged, how the man followed me, and everything else. But they barely reacted.

I think I tried to change their reaction inside the dream, like rewriting it to get the response I needed, but I can‚Äôt remember that part very well.
All I know is that when I woke up, I was like: ‚ÄúHoly shit, what a trauma.‚Äù

Two days ago i was at work (i only work the
weekend as i am still a uni student) and i was working at the entrance of my work place, a collegue and friend said to me ""i'm gonna grab my friend to make him enter"" (very commun as i work in a touristic job) she went to grab
him and in front of my face there he was, the man i saw in my dream, i kinda had forgotten that i had that dream but it instantly came to my mind very vivid, it was crazy it was litterally the same man as tall as in my dream, he said hi to me and i was just in shock, (just for your information i had never seen that guy irl ever it was the first time we met) by the time i though i would talk to him
at my break they where already gone in the building far away and i knew i couldnt find them with the amount of tourists in there and how big the building was.

1joay6s,There's something different about my hometown...,"I have this newly recurring dream (3 or 4 times over the last couple months) in which I'm visiting family back in my hometown, and it looks similar to where I actually grew up: smallish town, semi-arid, near mountains. But in each instance of this dream, there's an ""extra"" neighborhood on the edge of town that probably doubles the town's real-life population. It feels slightly removed from the rest of town and is located closer to the base of the mountains.

This neighborhood looks a little dusty, run-down, and more industrial, but when I ""visit"" it, I never get bad vibes or feel unsafe. If anything, I'm intrigued because I think ""why have I never seen this area on previous visits to my family here?""

Only once or twice have I been able to explore much. I seem to recall that, as I drive into the neighborhood from the main part of town, dusk is almost always approaching (except for once, when I drove into the neighborhood in broad daylight). I think it was during that lone daylight visit, I went inside a fast food or fast-casual restaurant that had neon signs inside. I remember excellent-smelling food behind glass partitions (kind of like Chipotle) and there were a good handful of people who all seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food.

That's about all. I so badly want to visit this place, because there's something so enticing/mysterious about it. Maybe it really does exist somewhere, but in a totally different town that I've only remembered subconsciously?

I've always been one to explore a place ""just because"" when I have the time, even if it means driving a little out of my way. Unfortunately, I'd have to *really* go out of my way for this one, since I now live on the east coast (U.S.), where semi-arid doesn't exist for a loooong stretch üòÇ

1jo4z7s,3 significant points,"My dream last night had a lot of parts but there were three points that stuck out:

- I was in what seemed like a hotel. Some older guy was fixing the place up and I wanted him to teach me how to lay concrete and fix the crumbling brick foundation. I end up in the lobby and a T-Rex shows up. Everyone says stay still, which I did but after when the trex turns away I run to hide. I hear everyone running and commotion happening while I try to hide behind a couch

- I was invited to the Jennifer Hudson show and they just finished the tunnel walk with Brenda Song. It was my turn to walk and nobody sang or clapped. They just looked down on their phones. I made it to the stage where Jennifer was sitting; there were children on a seperate stage rehearsing something. I wanted to tell her about the tunnel but instead I asked for baby wipes.
- Jennifer points to an area where the wipes might be but I end up in a small doctors office. The lady doctor who came in tried to help me find them but couldn‚Äôt. I kept walking down into a basement area that has a long walk of glass. On the opposite side was a massive Planet Fitness. I immediately go inside. There are loads of young men working out. I ask one how to join the gym. He says I have to essentially fight for a spot in the gym. I asked him if I could throw someone, would that get me in. He said sure if you can. So I picked up this small lady (pale skin, black hair, black sports bra and black leggings, both with aqua colored pattern trim) and was gonna toss her but didn‚Äôt. I told them I‚Äôll be back later and left through the street entrance. ",2,1
1joa8ne,"Dream about rare snakes, being bitten, biting back","A few nights ago I dreampt of many snakes crossing the road. A group of teenagers saw them and went the other way. I slowly and carefully went up to them to take a picture for ID on Inaturalist, and they were identified as ""Scoplomythrus Rarex"" or the ""San Diego Rarex"". These snakes looked similar to Gopher snakes except that they had a rosy tint on their dorsal side, and were quite stubby in length. I woke up (false awakening) in my bed, and it was dark, I felt something bite by left hand and caused it to go numb. I felt around with my right hand and it was that snake. Out of anger I bit said snake in retaliation, and woke up for real (I bit the pillow lol). ",1,0
1jnv7tu,dream where a dead person in my life came back,"backstory; 
in july, i was going on dates and talking to this guy that i REALLY liked. it was short lived, but he was very romantic and sweet, i developed deep feelings for him, and i never felt like this towards anyone before. he randomly ended things with me because he didnt like me enough (if u knew the whole story this made no sense) and then 5 days later, he passed away after getting hit by a car while riding his motorcycle. never forgot about him. we also have many mutual friends.



dream: 
a couple nights ago, i had a dream where i was sitting on my bed, and i got a snapchat notification of him typing. i opened my phone and he said ""hey"" and i said how are u texting me rn? he said oh i figured out how to and i said well where are you what happened after you died? he said ""i cant tell you but its chill i just get bored because all i can do is watch."" then all of a sudden im in the house that i lived in while we were talking and going on dates. he rang my doorbell and i opened it and he said hey so i snuck back onto earth but i only have today. so then im in his truck, but for some reason im sitting in the seat behind him, and i'm wearing the same outfit i had on from the last time i saw him. (6 days pre death). he said, ""i feel like no one gives af about me anymore"" and i said well i think about you every single day and he said yeah i know. then, it was basically a rerun of the last day i had with him, which was us watching 2 movies at a drive in movie with a whole setup in his truck bed. then he dropped me off and said well bye...
and i was like wait dont leave and he said i have to, and then he drove off.

a friend of mine said that she also had a dream where someone they knew who passed came back, and also said that they cant tell you what happens and where they are. has anyone else had this experience?

1jo9jo3,Can dreams really be an omen or is that a lie?,"A few weeks ago, I had a rather strange dream where I was in a dry forest at night. I was with my friend walking down a dark path, and a rather ugly woman with a more than horrifying appearance was following us. At one point, I looked back to see if she wasn't following us, only to turn around and find her right in front of me, but she was on top of my unconscious friend. She simply looked at me with her disgusting face, while she unbuttoned his pants with obvious intentions. I kicked her in the face and she suddenly vanished... My friend woke up and we continued walking until I magically went from being in a forest to a skyscraper, and there she was, only this time yelling at me that my time was up. The floor I was on magically changed shape into a ledge and made me slide to the edge of the building and fall, but my friend grabbed my hand and gave me a boost, preventing me from falling, and then out of nowhere, I woke up.

The truth is, the dream seemed a little strange to me because the day before I had that dream, my friend had a similar dream. Only in this dream, the one stalking us was a tall, bald man with a fork. According to what he told me, the man wanted to kill me because I reminded him of his daughter.

I don't really know if the phrase ""time is running out"" is some kind of omen... I mean, I'm 19 and I don't have any life-threatening illnesses, but oh well.",1,4
1jo3u23,I had a dream about pyrocynical (YouTube guy),"I had a dream about pyrocynical 

I was on some school field trip and we were going to a museum but the way to get there was to use underneath/underground bumper karts. so me and my friends start going but there's a delay because Harrison Fords car is on the track. I made a joke about hitting it and he had to moved it. Harrison Ford is there because Jack Quaid is also chaperoning us and Harrison Ford is his dad. After Harrison Ford moves his car we start going on the track. And then we got stopped again because this guy forgot to put up thin plastic sheets that make the walls look like rainbow road. And this is where Pyro comes in, me and some ppl (friends in my dream, not IRL) are stading waiting for this guy to put up the little stupid plastic sheets and Pyro says to us ""Don't worry this guy is just a pleb"" but he misspoke and  said ""Peb"" instead of ""Pleb"" we all started laughing at him. I think to make a joke dream pryo says well I'm single and then kinda freaks out because we all start yelling that we are kids (16-18) and we start laughing some more at Pyro. Also pyro is in some weird sonic costume but it's not like dark blue it's light. And to end the dream I pulled out my dream phone and on it was some fat guy laying down but with the phone camera at a high angle pointing down his body on TikTok and on the video it had some text that said ""The guy who pisses everything"" I wonder in my dream how he does it and in the corner of the video I see that him and Pyro mutuals on TikTok, and then I woke up to write this.

1jnnfxo,Met someone in dream. Fell in love in a way that I didn't know I could. Woke up and I legit feel like that person died and I'm mourning them.,"I've never felt the desire to find someone to become romantically involved with. At all. It's never bothered me at all. I like being who I am and I always felt like romantic relationships took away part of who I am when I was in them. 

But this dream....this person. The love was so real. It wasn't sexual or anything but def romantic. 

Then I woke up and I feel like I'm in mourning, because that person is gone. 

I met them at some type of dream version of a ""camp"". Like the kind that people go to in the summer when they were kids. You're together with people for a month then everyone leaves.

At the end she left and despite her having the same feelings in the dream. She said we lived too far apart and left without her having much emotion about it. 

This person was my soulmate, or something like that. I felt it. They felt it. It was SO real. Then I woke up and that person is gone, and my feelings remain. 

I'm not lonely, I have great friends. Have been in relationships as an adult. No regrets there. But this feeling is overwhelming. I thought it would go away as I woke up. But no... 8 hours later I still feel it as much as I did before. 


Anyone else somehow have that same dream last night? Or can anyone relate to this? This is the first time I've ever had one like this in my life and I'm 39",39,14
1jo3rqu,dreaming that i cant successfully call 911 during a crisis,"hey all! up until about 3 years ago, i‚Äôd never been one to have recurring dreams. ones that i remember, at least. 

over the course of the last 3 years, i‚Äôve had the recurring dream that i can‚Äôt successfully call for help. i‚Äôve had this dream now about 5 times or so. in the dreams, i will be in a dire, emergency situation. whether it‚Äôs me who‚Äôs in harms way or someone near me that‚Äôs in harms way, i will attempt to dial 911 in my dream. these dreams tend to be very lucid. in them, im fully using first person POV. i can look around, i can run, i can look down at my hands and operate my dream phone. 

what ends up happening when i do try reaching out to 911 is a variety of things, which happens at the different times i try calling:

-my thumbs begin to not work. i will be able to dial 911, but unable to press call.

-when i press the phone call icon on my iphone, it would open into a different app entirely. typically it opens up the safari search engine. 

-if i can call 911, there would be an infinite ring. never a pick up. just an infinite ringing.

-one time i did dial 911 with a successful pick up. however, when the call was answered, the person speaking back to me was speaking in complete word vomit gibberish. was quite scary actually. i couldn‚Äôt determine anything they were saying. there could‚Äôve been a big mix of different languages intertwining, too. 

-i can‚Äôt click anything on my phones screen at all. no buttons work, the screen doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs not necessarily frozen but it becomes inoperable the moment i *think* of dialing 911. 

these dreams are incredibly frustrating to deal with since i am otherwise fully lucid and capable in the dream. they are also very stressful, considering that im physically unable to call for help in a moment where there‚Äôs about to be aggression, killing, harm, kidnapping, etc. 

i‚Äôve never really tried to decipher the meaning behind this theme beginning in the first place. all i could imagine of it on the fly is around 3 years ago is when my girlfriend (now wife) and i had just moved into our first place together and i had felt an increased desire to protect not only ourselves but our home. i became more on edge about the possibility of an attempt on our safety being in our first place together. i can imagine that could manifest in the dreamworld.

1jo9081,My dreams are really starting to effect my mood/mental state to the point I think I need therapy,"I think I‚Äôve hit my breaking point.
For the past few months maybe even a year, I find my self in these repetitive dreams that are different each time but the setting and certain aspects are constants. Example: I‚Äôm in my childhood home and the basement a mess and that is something my parents would get mad at us for and I hated to be yelled at. (parents were never abusive or anything)explanatory- my anxieties are popping up) I can dive a lot further as these dreams are full of anxieties but for brevity sake I won‚Äôt. 
One that is so persistent, I‚Äôm in high school or a public area and I go to use the bathroom and each stall is incredibly filthy, unable to be used but I have no other option. Or the stall doors are taken off/ men and women are in the bathroom and I have to go in front of people. Typical anxiety filled situations‚Ä¶ granted odd lol. I dream every single night in this continually developing/changing setting or world as I call it, where it is my my elementary school, first highschool, the 2nd HS i transferred into, and my current college campus. But they are made up if that makes any sense? There are certain features that are exactly like the original locations but they are all completely built/manufactured in my dreams and exactly the same each time. Here and there the roads of my home town I‚Äôm often driving on. My friends houses are so distinctly the same in each dream but they look nothing like how they did in real life when I was younger. Like my brain is creating these houses and settings and remembering each tiny detail and dreaming in it the next night. 

I‚Äôm finding the more I try to explain what I‚Äôm thinking in my head the less I‚Äôm able to get the point across. I wish I had the knowledge to speak more thoroughly  and intelligently about this. This was just a very quick frustrated rant entry I should probably take time to explain deeper, that is if anyone would have input and want to hear it ",1,25

1jnzkhx,"I‚Äôve been dreaming of the same man for years, and it feels too real to ignore. Has anyone else experienced this?","I don‚Äôt even know where to start because this feels absolutely insane, but I need to talk about it.

For years‚Äîsince I was a young teenager‚ÄîI‚Äôve been having recurring dreams about the same man. The weirdest part? I don‚Äôt know him in real life. He‚Äôs not someone I‚Äôve ever met, not even a celebrity. But every time I see him in my dreams, I just know him. It‚Äôs an overwhelming feeling of familiarity, like I‚Äôve known him forever, like we grew up together somehow.

As the years passed, he aged with me. In the early dreams, he was younger, but now he‚Äôs in his twenties like me. He has a very distinct presence‚Äîtall, with sharp facial features, short dark hair, and an intimidating look. But despite his appearance, he radiates warmth. In every dream, I feel an indescribable sense of peace when I‚Äôm with him, like all my worries and overthinking completely disappear. I‚Äôm usually very guarded, but with him, it‚Äôs effortless.

The most striking thing in all these dreams is his hands. They‚Äôre large, warm, and grounding. I always find myself holding them, and the moment I do, it‚Äôs like everything in the world just falls into place. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt even see his face‚ÄîI just hold his hand, and I know it‚Äôs him. His presence feels so real that even after waking up, I can still feel the warmth lingering. It‚Äôs like my soul recognizes him in a way my mind can‚Äôt comprehend.

These aren‚Äôt just random dreams either. Every time, it‚Äôs different, but the essence remains the same. We walk together, talk, hold each other, and just exist in a way that feels more real than anything I‚Äôve ever experienced while awake. The emotions are so deep that when I wake up, I feel an unbearable sense of loss, like I‚Äôm grieving someone I‚Äôve never met. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm missing a piece of myself that only exists in those dreams.

Here‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs really been messing with me: I have a boyfriend in real life. He‚Äôs great, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right somehow. And whenever I try to convince myself that maybe he is the one, I dream of him again. It‚Äôs like my subconscious (or something else?) is reminding me of what real connection feels like. I‚Äôm not even a romantic person‚Äîif anything, I‚Äôm usually very anti-romance‚Äîbut with him, I crave it so deeply.

I don‚Äôt know what this means. Is it just my subconscious? A past life connection? A twin flame? Something else entirely? And the craziest part‚ÄîI feel like I know his name, but I just can‚Äôt remember it. It‚Äôs always on the tip of my tongue, but I can‚Äôt grasp it no matter how hard I try.

I‚Äôve tried to ignore these dreams for years, but now I feel like I can‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs too vivid, too consistent, too real. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",4,1
1jo8s92,Face of many stitches,"I'm in a pitch black room, a large bathroom. I see something white on the floor and pick it up. It's a mask but it's creepy. It's texture is like a dried hide. The mask has a permanent smile on its face and it has several areas of grotesque stitching along it's surface. Pulling on the mask loosens this string, making it warp and twist.

Suddenly I'm joined by two other creatures, both mostly blacked out. I think another one also had a white mask not unlike a plague doctor, but if it did, it was barely visible. They kept going ""ew"" and ""whats going on"" repeatedly while looking at one another, seemingly perturbed by each other's presence. Then after a number of minutes, they rounded on me and started freaking out. ""What the fuck, why is she stretching her face like that"" and ""Gross, who the fuck is that lady?""

Suddenly the white stitch mask was me. I had no body, I was just the face. The creatures grabbed me and kept pulling and stretching my skin, repeatedly going ""Who are you"" and ""why are you doing this"". This went on for a few minutes.

I got so scared and uncomfortable that I woke up.",1,1
1jo0x75,"I Keep Dreaming Entire Movies Full Plots, Twists, Sound, and Actors. Why?","
I don‚Äôt know how many times this has happened now, but I keep dreaming of entire movies that my brain creates from scratch. These aren‚Äôt just vague or fragmented dreams‚Äîthey have full plotlines, plot twists, real actors playing roles, and even background music and sound design as if I‚Äôm sitting in a cinema.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just recalling movies I‚Äôve seen before. These are completely original, as if my subconscious is making them up on the spot. Sometimes, I wake up remembering them in extreme detail, like I just watched a full feature film in my sleep.

For context, I‚Äôm a video editor and graphic designer, so maybe my brain is wired to process visuals and storytelling this way. I also have ADHD and some autistic traits, which I‚Äôve heard can make dreams more vivid. But this level of detail still blows my mind.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Could this be linked to hyperphantasia, neurodivergence, or just an overactive imagination? Curious to hear if others have dreams like this or any theories on why it happens!

It was dark,but not completely.
Small earthquakes started to happen,with each earthquake the walls seemed to move a bit inwards to the center of the room each time.
Until,a huge earthquake happened and one side of the wall was ready to squish us and collapse on us while there was a hole in that wall...
I tried to peak inside this hole but it was pitch black inside...then i heard someone talking inside saying ""I'm Mitzrael"".

I‚Äôve been stressed recently and have been feeling really emotional. I miss my boyfriend (he‚Äôs an hour and a half away from me but I live in the city so it can be longer, depending on traffic) and I just saw him this weekend. 

Anyway, onto the dream, I don‚Äôt remember a whole lot from it because I had amnesia IN the dream?? 

I have a son. Every dream I‚Äôve had with kids is ALWAYS a son and it‚Äôs the same kid with my boyfriend being the father. This time I guess I forgot about being in labor and two days after that. I was bedridden but my kid was healthy and safe. Everything felt so real. My stomach hurt, I was bleeding from down there and had to use a pad with aloe Vera (very specific lmao) and I was getting help from fsmily and friends. Everything was super emotional. Boyfriend was there with me. I had to write down something for my son but I didn‚Äôt know how much he weighed, but he was a tiny baby. My boyfriend also said, in real life, that he‚Äôd want a son and to name him Toby.

1jnlidz,Aliens gave me an otherworldly luxury spa experience,"This was really vivid. I woke up and there was a gray alien by my bed, the usual 'little green man' type with big eyes.  He was so short his head was all I could see looking over the edge of the mattress. I asked what he was doing there seeing as I had locked the front door that night? He said he something to show me so I followed him out to the living room where 3 more aliens were sat on the couch waiting for us. Their feet were gecko like and didn't reach the floor.  Together we all went into the den, but instead it was a beautiful spa room overlooking a lush tropical coastline.

The aliens explained they had been trying to show folks this spa but everyone would get scared and refuse to follow. So I went to check it out. It was a pretty standard spa experience with face mask, hair wash, cute little drink (mint tea with lemon slices in it). Except that they also unspooled my brain.

How this worked was I was lying back in the spa chair looking over the view and the back of my head opened cleanly, without blood. They unraveled my brain and clipped it to one of those circular clothes  drying racks that hangs from the ceiling. It felt like a really good stretch except out of the back of my head, very weird. Sometimes my brain looked like guts, other times it was strings of fabric or beads and other times long gray twist of matter more similar to how an actual brain might be.

Then they started removing bits of fluff and gunk from it with combs, which felt like someone brushing my hair. The fluff looked like lint and if you looked close it turned into TV static. The gunk just looked like snot. The aliens apologized for having let it get this bad. I joked they could remove some of my traumatic memories while they were back there, but the alien very sadly said he wasn't qualified to work so close to the brainstem. He seemed like he was going to cry so I quickly changed the subject and said how nice the accomodations were. 

Then the view changed to third person and they were putting my brain back in, which now looked like those magnetic string toys and snapped back into my head in a similar way. I was relieved it was going back in so easily because I had been sort of worried they wouldn't put it back they way it was.",35,10

A small tv was playing in the background, two men were on it, talking in a middle eastern language.   My dad was there standing beside me.

Everything was familiar - the roads, buildings, and surroundings. We were near a bridge where a traffic police officer was trying to stop a vehicle, but it didn't stop. The officer threw a big bamboo stick at the vehicle's back, causing it to collapse and the glass to shatter. The vehicle stopped, and some other police officers from a different state got out and slapped the traffic police officer. After that, my father, uncle, and I started climbing a newly made staircase with a bridge. Then, the scene shifted, and I found myself with two criminals, a boy and a girl, who were killing people and eating their bodies. I was in a room with them, and the boy was cooking human meat. He started serving me, but then the girl came in and closed the door. They both started asking me for my money, trying to loot me. They told me to leave my purse and leave, but I wanted them to be caught. The weird thing is, I have no idea how I ended up in their room or what I was doing there. I escaped the room and ran through the balcony, where I found a gate. I used a pin to lock the gate, trapping them on the balcony, and then left the building. I found their scooty and drove it without keys to my old house, then went to the police station. When I arrived, the criminals were already there, and they were trying to negotiate with me. The girl said 'I can do whatever you want,(the girl was looking good and trying to flirt with me) just don't file a police complaint.'

1jo2wwo,Snakes,Hey! This is my first time doing this but just been dealing with a lot in my life right now and had this weird dream. I was dropping my best friend off for work and I was going to go tan near the river and this black snake just approached us then we look up and in the distance a python is standing up slithering to us as well. Obviously I got scared and jumped awake but wonder if this could mean anything. Thank you!!,1,0
1jo2ork,shameful nightmare?,"I honestly don‚Äôt know if it counts as a nightmare or just a really intense dream, but I literally JUST woke up and am still trying to calm myself down. Long story short, in the dream I had somehow been involved in a car wreck during high school graduation (I graduated years ago) that involved me blacking out at the wheel and driving into cars in front of me, and then my childhood home. I remember intense feelings of anxiety and panic in the dream after I had did it but didn‚Äôt wake up until someone in the dream showed me a video of me wrecking on their phone. It felt shameful and so, so real. 

I immediately broke down to tears when I woke up, feelings of shame I didn‚Äôt even know I still felt came up and it really affected me emotionally. I don‚Äôt even remember dreams much as I smoke often, so this is completely out of left field. I get nightmares like this periodically but I‚Äôm usually pretty good at dissecting why I had them, this has stumped me. Now that I‚Äôm thinking about it a LOT of my dreams/nightmares I‚Äôve had over the years involve driving an out of control vehicle so this is different.",1,1
1jo2fi5,Dreaming of someone who told you to find them in real life?,"TLTR/ met a man in a world I had elaboraty dreamed of before, he told me to find him in RL. 

Today, I was spending a lot of time in bed and sleeping as I'd had a sudden bought of nausea that knocked me around, and so slept for about 12 hours on and off, with some slight redisual nausea. I had insanely vivid dreams, all which felt important - like I was saving the world in an alternate universe, lol - but none I really remember as starkly as this one. This is where it gets specific...
I met a man in a place I had dreamt of before, which in my dreams I knew was my little apartment complex in a really nice coastal city, ai had seen the other parts of the city and even ridden on a bus into it, seeing the place from a mountain range as we decended. I'd been to the lakes there in other dreams, very like northern Australia or even Bali, or a mix of the two. I'd been to shopping centres and walked around the shops in other dreams. I knew when i visted this place, and could disrunguish it from other dreams. 
The apartment we met in was his, and it was like he paid for top-teir accommodation rather than my basic apartment. And this man..I knew he was my soul mate. I can't even say it was just an innate feeling..we both spoke about it instantly and laughed as we spoke at the same time. We were then insanely curious about each other, I remember being so instantly comfortable that I grabbed him by the head and moved it side to side, really looking at him. He eventually peeled me off and wr talked - this conversation, I remember not much of..except that he told me to find him in real life. I remember stopping looking around his fancy apartment, comparing it with my own, and looking at him saying ""but this is just a dream."" Now, I'm able to lucid dream quite easily, and these dreams in this world were always half lucid. The structure of the world was solid, I couldn't manipulate it, but I could do as I pleased, even fly, within it. This dream was the same, and after telling the man this, he laughed and pulled out a piece if paper. It looked like a resume, with his photo to the top right, and a few paragraphs with bullet points underneath. Right at the top was his name..and at that point I flipped. Could it be real? I remember my jaw dropping and looking at him, he hugged me and grabbed me by the shoulders and repeated his name, and to find him. I remember looking at the paper, almost panicking trying to make sure I would remember. It was like it was imperative to the very fabric of this world that we found each other, and I remembered his name. I have remembered songs I've written in dreams before, just simple verses or melodies, but nonetheless. 
I'm 70% sure it started with an I, and I'm pretty sure it may have been Isaiah. He even had his last name, something a bit longer. He was a content creator, or similar, maybe wrote books? I just remember laughing about how rich he was and teasing him about it, and him just smiling back at me. 
I can always tell when my dreams are ending, and when that feeling started I began to cry. He held me on his arms and said it would be okay. I remember looking into his eyes and him wiping my tears. I woke up in bed crying.

Now..thisbis a longshot, but I'm wondering if this is subconscious or if it is somehow a connection with someone real? I believe in the metaphysical realm, but am also scientific minded..I have been getting into quantum physics lately and am fascinated with quantum entanglement.
 But maybe we can somehow reunite the two of us, if he us somehow a real person and not my brain subconsciously wanting connection...I am in a committed year long relationship, but we could have more connection I guess. But on the tiny chance he is real..
His name began with I, like I said, and could've been Isiah. He had dark short hair, full but neat facial hair, blue eyes, and the closest resemblance I can come up with is Ryan Gosling, but with dark hair. 
Let's cross our fingers and hope he's out there...but I'm also curious to know others opinions on this, whether anyone can give me insight to if this had happened to them too, or what the meaning behind it could be. I'm not mad if I'm told my brain subconsciously made it all up, either. Just curiosity, as this is such an elaborate dreamscape...and usually, there is only NPC characters in the dream, and I never interact with them like I usually do in other dreams. It's like there's only me in a videogame, free to explore, guided by the NPCs, and this guy was another real player. 

Anyway, leave your comments and insights, I need others opinions on this, lol.

1jnx49s,My dreams are becoming more intense.,"Recently, I'm unable to have a continuous sleep. I wake up at night either perspiring or feel cold, mostly because the dreams become too intense on my brain. Like my head just sorta gives up and shakes itself from sleep. And when i wake up, I'm overwhelmed by incoherent thoughts. Too many of em. 

However today's dream was the worst. I don't remember much about dream except what was happening it. It was about me and my sister going to a university. There is a student in the dream who has concealed his psycho dad in the university. In the first cycle of the dream, I was totally unaware of the situation and I don't remember what happened much in between except that the dream ended with my sister dead. I woke up for an instant and then went back to sleep. The second dream was recurrence of the first one. Except this time I was trying to figure out what is happening and how to prevent it. I don't remember much but it ended the same. Then there were many cycles of the same thing and everytime i figured out something new and tried to stop in. I just know that in one of the cycle i found out that the psycho dad will escape and kill his son then kill my sister. I had to basically figure out where he is hidden and kill him first. 

The most horrifying part was that there were times where I'd say to myself that it's and it's not happening. Then I'd run my fingers on benches and walls and run through the lobbies of the university and say to myself 'this is real and it's happening, it's not a dream.' It all seemed so real that I woke up and still felt like i had to go to university. It struck me that i was dreaming only after few minutes when i started forgetting the details and remembered that i will be starting university in Novemeber.

It scares me that I was so consumed by the cycle that it took me a while to differentiate between dream and reality. The only significant detail i remember is that there were no calendars or mention of dates in the dream. But the picture of my sister and my conversations with her felt very real. 

I also remember waking a few times in between and asking myself, if i was just dreaming or do i have to go through everything again and then going back to sleep and dreaming the same. I remember that none of the details left me and i don't remember much about the university but i remember that the son, my sister and the place where they were killed were so consistent that it felt almost continuous. 

I remember the son was lanky and quiet but sharp with replies. He had blonde curly hair. Blue eyes. White. Not exactly handsome but average looking. 

It's a long post but i had to share this. I'm having hard time sleeping or keeping my mind calm when i wake up at night. I need some help or suggestions.",3,0
1jnwx2w,"Hi guys, I‚Äôve just had a nice dream that was super scary but I don‚Äôt get why??","Basically, I had a dream where I‚Äôd done some not very friendly things, but then someone I know only briefly, comforted me and told me it was ok and that I‚Äôm ok exactly as I am. 

Him telling me I was fine and the comfort, felt fine in the dream from what I remember, but when I woke it was like I‚Äôd had a horrific dream about a traumatic event (I have PTSD and the dreams were like how I felt after my dreams relating to SA years ago, but those dreams don‚Äôt happen anymore). I literally couldn‚Äôt catch my breath and was super scared when I woke up. 

This dream should have been a positive? So why did it feel so scary?? I was hoping for some opinions on what this could mean?

I‚Äôve drew on it that I‚Äôm terrified of showing my true self as I‚Äôm scared of being rejected for it? But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm oversimplifying it?

I‚Äôve attached what I‚Äôve wrote after I‚Äôve just woke up, just to try and explain a bit better how it made me feel on waking if that gives some kind of substance to it all  and helps pin point what the dream meant.

It‚Äôs just made me feel so weird tbh.

1jnyeun,Sex dream... With my dad?,"Using a throwaway account because I am so embarrassed with myself. 

So, i don't have a huge relationship with my dad because of us not seeing eye to eye on his parenting method (be absent mentally and letting my abusive mum take the reigns) but we do talk once in a while and there have been no issues or warnings that might led me to have this dream. 

But this morning I had a dream about exactly what I said, that I was having sex with my dad, at least trying to. We both were into it and we tried to hide it from my mum. It just makes me feel very very disgusted about myself once I woke up. I wish I could forget it, but it just is one of the dreams that just stick with you.

1jo0qia,Dream about childhood toys/games that never really existed,"For context, last night was rough. I am 9 months estranged from my abusive father, and he reached out to me via email last night‚Ä¶ basically saying all of the things he should have said over a decade ago. But I prayed for clarity last night. 

I had a dream about seeing these childhood toys and feeling really nostalgic over them. So nostalgic that I was emotional in the dream, and sending photos to them to my younger brother to see if he remembered them. Which by the way, is something that I sometimes do in real life. 

When I woke up and thought about the toys I saw, I realized that I don‚Äôt even think they‚Äôre real. But I felt so nostalgic for them in my dream. 

I didn‚Äôt have a great childhood. Like I said, my father was abusive, but he always bought me anything I wanted. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs why I have this excitement about finding toys I forgot about, because that‚Äôs really all I had growing up‚Ä¶ material things. Plastic. 

I know that in any abusive relationship, you‚Äôre often made to feel like you‚Äôre doing something wrong by ending things or cutting someone off. But sometimes I get in my head so much that I feel like I‚Äôm lying about what he did to me‚Ä¶ despite the proof, despite the witnesses.

I enter an old hospital. I‚Äôm in the lobby, and there‚Äôs a very large spiral staircase and a elevator. I spot a nurse a few floors up, and I say 'hello!' to her, and she responds. She‚Äôs wearing a blue uniform and a small old-fashioned hat. I need to take the elevator to meet her. The lobby is empty and cold, and the rest of the hospital has the same tone. In front of the elevator, there‚Äôs a wheelchair. On it, there‚Äôs a bucket, a sheet, and a piece of cloth. I turn away for a moment, and when I look back at the wheelchair, the bucket is on the floor and the sheet is covering it to hide what‚Äôs inside (I realize it‚Äôs a bucket of excrement). Since no one is around, I realize that there‚Äôs an entity or a ghost behind this movement, and I get scared. I shout to the nurse, 'I saw something!' (meaning a paranormal phenomenon), and she responds, 'Oh, already?' (surprised that it happened so quickly but not surprised it happened at all). I decide to take the stairs instead, and before I begin, a large white sheet unfurls at the level of the staircase (like in movies, a sheet with knots to climb, like those used by characters in films to scale walls).

Years later my child gets a partner, they get married, and have 2 kids. I meet my grand babies after birth then it zooms through me watching them grow up while also being there for them. Next thing I know, I'm on my death bed, my kid, their partner, and kids around my bed while we're at the hospital. They're smiling but crying saying it'll be alright, that I'll be in a better place and I lived a good life... I then pass away, but opened my eyes after that dream. I felt so hollow, empty, grief, and a gut wrenching feeling of never being able to hold my child again, to see my grand babies again, to hear both of their laughters as they grew up. I felt hollow for some time after that and still do till this day that I'm posting this. I also have had a feeling of me not being able to have kids or something like that but I don't actually know if I'm infertile or not but its just a feeling. Everytime I watch videos of people's children, babies, partners holding or teaching their kid(s), I end up either almost crying or I end up sobbing while the video plays on repeat because I start feeling that empty feeling in my guy again. Sometime I hold onto my stomach and cry because I'm afraid of not being able to have a kid or excited to have a kid.

Eventually the friends new GF finds me, but she takes me back to her place. When we arrive, there are 5 strangers there. She‚Äôs takes one super valuable thing from each of us, and places in into a safe/ drawer. I don‚Äôt remember what she took from me, but I remember she stole one of the strangers glasses, which rendered her blind and helpless.

1jnv0vb,Hey all! Just wanted to share some of my more weird/disturbing dreams (some are kind of gory),"If there is anything you can interpret from these i am interested to hear your thoughts! just a side note, some of these are copied from my ""dream journal"" section of my notes, so my thoughts might be a little scrambled. Sorry this post is so long! 

Dream 1:

i had a dream i was in england (probably bc of my obsession with heartstopper lol) but in this dream i worked at a Panda Express that was a sit down restaurant and also served starbucks drinks. it was my first day and an older lady ordered an iced brown sugar shaken espresso. i was trying for 10-15 mins to find the recipe and make it correctly, and people were getting frustrated with me, but not helping. i eventually just decided to walk home and on my way home i came across police and investigators pulling a partially dismembered body out of a trash can. i watched them pull an arm out, and then the lower half of the body (both legs were still attached, but the body was cut from the waist down). the trash can was filled with liquid, and there was blood all over the road. i watched them for a while before one of the officers nudged his head to my right, where there was a separate road for me to go on. i didn't notice it because i was so intrigued by their findings, but i decided to walk that way instead and let them do their jobs.

Dream 2:

i had a dream that my mom, my boyfriend, step dad, and my biological dad all went to my grandparents house (on my mom's side). the house looked different in my dream, but i knew that's where i was. my mom kept getting calls from a random number and insisting it was my dad (he was literally there so im not sure why she thought this lmao). i was arguing with her, trying to show her that the number calling her wasn't my dad. out of nowhere, a bunch of zoo animals appeared, but specifically big cats (lions, tigers, etc). they were trying to kill us. i remember asking my mom if i should call the cops and she told me no because my grandparents would be in big trouble for having all of those animals on their property. i then stepped out onto the porch with just my grandma and she hugged me and told me she had cancer again. i hugged her tight and told her i love her. my boyfriend and i managed to escape somehow, but we decided to go back to try and save everyone. when we walked into the house again, i watched my grandpa get mauled by a tiger. there was so much blood it was kind of traumatic. i could hear him screaming ""this tiger is going to kill me."" then, another tiger came up to me and i kept trying to kick it and whack it with my purse. i woke up as i was swinging my purse at it. 

Dream 3:

this is a dream i remember having as a kid. this was after my parents got divorced. my mom and i were waiting for my dad to come home from work so we could all go out to eat together. after a while, my mom got angry and was tired of waiting so we decided to just leave even though he hadn't come home yet. i don't remember the ride there, i just remember walking into the restaurant and turning a corner. i saw my dad laying on the floor, dead, in a pool of his own blood. i just remember seeing him there and feeling my heart drop into my toes.

Dream 4 (last one):

this is another dream i had as a child. i remember being at my grandparents house yet again with both of my parents. it was getting late and i wanted to go to bed so my dad picked me up and started carrying me down the stairs to the basement. i remember trying to talk and freaking out because my words wouldn't come out. my dad immediately calmed me down and reassured me that i was only dreaming and i would wake up soon. he then tucked me in and kissed my forehead and that's when i woke up.

1jnxwat,A recurring theme in different childhood dreams,"From a young age, I had a recurring dream that always followed the same story line in different formats. Every dream would involve establishing some sort of superpower for me to have, like flying or shooting energy beams from my hand, and I'd use the power fine, but then I'd be attacked. 

Sometimes it was some sort of monster, other times it was just a person with a gun, and every time I'd try to use this power I'd just established to save myself, it wouldn't work when I needed it the most.

I'd be unable to fly away, or I'd aim my hands and nothing would happen no matter how much I tried, and then, I'd die, and jolt awake in a panic. 

The earliest I can recall these dreams is from when I was around 8 years old. The early versions of these dreams were simpler, like the example about not being able to fly away when I needed to, but later as a teenager, I would repeatedly dream about having a gun, but having it jam and not work the moment I needed it, and then being shot. 

Again, waking up in a sudden jolt. 

I'd have a dream that followed these beats every few months or so, and it always confused me. The dreams seemed to finally stop when I was around 19 or 20. 

In hindsight, I think I was just a kid with awful anxiety. 

Thank you if you read this far. Tbh this memory just suddenly occurred to me now and I felt like typing it out.",1,0
1jnxv5c,Can anyone make sense of this dream,"I slept right after a call from my brother. Started dreaming about my phone that was near my head and was sleeping
I picked it up and put some random numbers in the dialpad and the phone went black and completely stuck. Tried restarting but it didn't work. The screen showed grey black n white screen which somehow camoflagued my finger. At this point I realized it was a dream and I tried getting up. I woke up and saw my pillow on my chest sat an angle and moved it walked outside my room. I saw the time it was 4pm. I slept around 11:30am. I was not supposed to sleep for that long, except I noticed the second hand was not moving at all. 
I woke up again
In the same setting, pillow on my chest. 
I ran to my mom this time crying screaming for help cause I couldn't wake up
I told her to slap me awake
She slapped me. It didn't hurt. 
I woke up again in the same setting
Now I went out and sat in the veranda. 
My dad came asked what's happening. 
I told him about the dream. Every single detail
He didn't give any reaction
His reaction felt so off that I realised it's a dream again
So I woke up again in the same setting now really scared
I knew I was stuck and couldn't get up. 
My dad came and woke me in real life
And I actually woke up for real
It was 12:30pm. When I woke up my face was below a pillow and I was sleeping on my stomach. My phone was nowhere near me. Wrote this just after waking up. 

This is my second stuck in a loop dream, where I desperately wanted to wake up but couldn't until someone else really woke me up. 
First one was about my ear phones. Where my earphones were continuously playing songs even after I removed them multiple times. I couldn't hear anyone talking to me. This one happened about an year ago. I actually slept with earphones so the dream. 

Edit- my mom just told me that I was actually sleeping my back with a pillow on my chest and later changed positions",1,0
1jnxqgg,Help what does this mean,"I can't find an exact description to help me understand this but I'm terrified . I had a dream without goin to full detail at some point I started attacking my sister and I snatch a patch of her hair out she then appeared bald and everyone in the in the room looked at me with disappointment and walked away from me . I remember feeling in my dream as if I f'd up and can't come be from that. Next thing you know my dream switches and I fall into a hole where I'm screaming for my boyfriend for help . At some point I realized that I was dreaming and couldn't wake up so I screamed for my boyfriend even more . The setting change and I'm not in a kitchen walking around scattering the room screaming for my boyfriend who I can't find and I'm in a room full of men that are just starring at me and watching me scream for my bf until I woke up. 

Key details in my waking life : I'm on good terms with my sister . I just nah to the club so maybe that's why I'm dreaming of being in a room of strange men . I just need to know what snatching someone bald means ü•¥",1,1

1jnxgkp,Here‚Äôs a good one for interpretation,"So when I was in high school my school had a program if interested or had enough credits to leave (but they still wanted to count you for attendance) it was a mechanical engineering program.  One day while going to school my mother informed me that I would join the program. Here‚Äôs the thing; I was always one to Absorb things that grabbed my attention and figure out how to use it, modify, etc. I had heard about the program but it didn‚Äôt really interest me so I was like I don‚Äôt think I wanna do that, but it had already been decided by my parents. This program taught usage of manual machines, and cnc as your first course. While I‚Äôd did well in the program I wasn‚Äôt into it. One weekend I went over family house and offered to take me to school (mech pro) in the morning. Apparently I fell asleep w/my eyes open (been a thing since I was little) and stood in the corner swinging my hands and trying to apparently mark something on my diagram. They tried to wake me but apparently I kept pushing them back saying it‚Äôs hot do touch it and continued to work. I did not finish that program for a few reasons but now my youngest brother is going into engineering and it brought back that memory of freaking everyone out. Btw at the time I was around 15/16 and never sweated this program in day hours and I to this day don‚Äôt remember it from myself but from the collection of ppl repeating it to me and up until that dream and after never had another one so what was that about?

1jnxgf1,"Why do I only wake up when a dream is ‚Äúover‚Äù, not in the middle?","How come every time I wake up in the middle of the night, it‚Äôs immediately following the end of a dream? By the end I mean, the natural summation of the story (ending credits if you will). There‚Äôs never a cliffhanger, it feels like each dream good or bad wraps up nicely just seconds before I wake up.

1jnxdg8,I keep having dreams about me cheating?,"The tldr is going to be at the end. I‚Äôm going to give a lot of context cus I‚Äôd like an answer if anyone knows what this means.

So yk the troupe of women getting pissed at their bfs or husbands because they cheated on them in the woman‚Äôs dreams? Yeah that but I‚Äôm the cheater here and idk how to feel. 

Context:
- I‚Äôm 22f and in my last year of college
- it‚Äôs usually me and my ex
- never hooking up with my ex but usually us on a date or pda. In my dream I know about my current bf and I know it‚Äôs wrong for my and him to do the things we do (hug, kiss, cuddle on a couch, ect)
- my ex and I dated for like 3-4 months my senior year of high school. He was my first everything and he dumped me over snap chat so there was absolutely no closure
- our relationship was one sided. I was the emotionally invested one while he only wanted the physical stuff, it was bad at times
- last night was different, last night I dreamt I was meeting two guys in public and one of them was literally the hottest man on the earth (to me and my preferences). Again I still knew about my current bf
- me and my current bf have been dating for 3 years

Idk what this means. It usually starts with me and my ex just chatting and then it‚Äôll skip to a point where we‚Äôre cuddling, hugging, kissing, or talking romantically. Sometime throughout the convo I will either remember my current bf and get secretive all of the sudden, or I‚Äôll see him in another part of the room and almost (but never do) get caught. I wake up in the mornings confused and feeling like crap. My relationship with my ex was horrible, never in a million years would I ever go back. And never in a million years would I want someone over my bf right now. We‚Äôre getting married in a few years after I graduate and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. 

This all got sparked because I had another one of those dreams last night. But only this was a random stranger than I was meeting up with. These two dudes come out of nowhere and we start instantly flirting. Completely aware of my bf I continued flirting. I feel horrible, I never have or will cheat. I dispise it. I have little to no forgiveness for it. But why does this keep happening to me. What does it meanüò≠

Tldr: I‚Äôm cheating on my bf in my dreams and I have no idea why. I‚Äôm happy. We‚Äôre healthy. I feel like crap and idk what this all means. ",1,0
1jnxaqu,Dreaming of a child wanted help,"I slept in my parents' room since they weren‚Äôt home that day. I woke up at some point, but I didn‚Äôt realize I was still dreaming. Because of the big closet, the room felt a bit different. As I was about to head toward the closet, I suddenly stumbled upon a girl in a white dress with puffy sleeves. She had long, straight hair with bangs and wore a headband. But then, I saw the silhouette of two women holding her by the arms. That‚Äôs when I got scared and wanted to leave the room. As I tried to walk away, the girl grabbed my hand and pleaded, ""Please, let me come with you. I need to tell my mom."" She told me she was only 7 years old and even her name.

I was terrified. Even in my dream, I was cursing, desperately trying to wake up.and I keep cursing just so I can wake up. She kept begging me to tell her mom, but I was too scared. All the words I keep hearing was ""tell my mom"" ""find my mom"" When I finally woke up, I was crying, it was so intense. I wrote the details as fast so I will never forget. The image of those two eerie figures behind her is still in my memory. I don't even know what to do with that dream. It was so long, so specific, and so vivid.

In the dream I was sitting by a closed window just looking at nothing. It opened onto a sort of roof that was about level with the bottom of the window. I saw a large black cat approaching (mane coon big), it was obviously a stray, was dirty and mangy. It looked me right in the eye as it walked up, in a way that felt almost human. It scared the shit out of me, and I didn‚Äôt want to let it inside but I felt like I had to. As I was opening the window a bunch of normal cats came rushing up to me. The large cat saw them coming and slowly walked away. The other cats crowded the window, and I started pulling them inside with someone else (can‚Äôt remember who). The cats were frantic but friendly. None attacked me or struggled as I picked them up. I remember being upset that the other cat walked away, but figured I‚Äôd have another chance to invite it in. Despite the fact that I felt like I shouldn‚Äôt at first. 

What could this is mean? That black cat scared me. It didn‚Äôt feel like a cat, just something that looked like one. ",2,2

1jnw28c,Recurring Nightmare from when I was young,"When I was younger, I would have this recurring nightmare that I must‚Äôve have 10-15 times across my young years. I am a young adult now and I‚Äôm trying to piece together some strange dreams I‚Äôve had. It would always start the same, I would be on the bottom bunk of my bunk bed, and I would be imagining somewhere across the room, focusing on an object or two. For example, my most memorable one was a Minecraft chest. All of a sudden, I would get really uncomfortable and realize that everything around me was huge, but like stretching actively. The item I focused on was also huge but still the same size, only because of how far it was. As soon as I realized this, and tried to figure out what I was seeing, it would shoot away and start to shrink a bit. Then I would kinda jolt awake, but not like that hypnic jolt thing, just startle awake and when I did, I see that everything was the same as normal. I‚Äôve read online about Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, and think that maybe it was something similar, but it was only when I was younger and I have only experienced it once since then, but it was a few years ago. Any help interpreting this would be amazing",1,2
1jnvu38,Rubber ducks in my scalp?,"I had a really weird dream last night and it‚Äôs been affecting me a lot. When I think about it I start to shake and get goosebumps all over my body.

I was looking in a mirror touching my scalp. I could text a smooth texture at one point. It wasn‚Äôt my scalp. It fell like smooth plastic. My fingers found the edge of it and I popped it out and to my shock‚Ä¶it was a rubber duck like a bath toy. As I ran my fingers thru my scalp I could feel the crater left behind. But there were more in other parts of my scalp. I looked down at the bathroom sink and realized I had pulled out 7. All the same size but different colors. I now had multiple craters in my scalp. I remember feeling ‚Äúdirty‚Äù like how did these things get in my scalp and how could I let that happen? I remember I could not or did not see myself in the mirror after I had pulled them out. The mirror was a blur. Then I woke up. 

I was trying to think of what it could mean but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. Lately I‚Äôve been self conscious of my hair. I‚Äôve had issues with my iron anemia and recently  my hair has been feeling thin to me. I‚Äôve had really thick hair my whole life so this feels strange to me.

When I think about the dream I get chills throw out my body and I feel like I‚Äôm going to be sick. I even get cold and start to feel so uneasy.

1jnjltj,My Dream about a Raptor with a minigun,"My dream about a Raptor with a minigun from 2021.¬†

Had a seriously scary dream that reminded me of Turok (video game). It haunted me for weeks after with how vivid the detail was. I‚Äôve never forgotten those details, tried to convey them below, hope it doesn‚Äôt give anyone nightmares as it did me.

\-

My wife and I were driving into a car tunnel when, suddenly, all the cars in front of us slammed on their brakes. Confused about what was happening, a massive plume of smoke and dust suddenly rushed toward us, clouding the entire tunnel. Almost immediately, we felt an explosion, and in my rearview mirror, I saw the tunnel entrance collapse. Moments later, the track lighting buzzed and went dark. It all unfolded so quickly, it felt like it was happening all at once. From that point on, the only light in the tunnel came from our headlights, but the smoke and dust made it nearly impossible to see anything. We were shouting at each other to turn off the cars, terrified of carbon monoxide poisoning.

We were driving a 1983 Chevy Silverado single cab, with a Ruger 22 rifle providing cozy lumbar support for us. I turned off the truck, grabbed my gun, and started heading toward the other side of the tunnel, using my shirt to cover my face from the smoke and dust. By then, the smoke was stinging my eyes, and the people around us had become little more than muffled shadows. As soon as I started walking, the unmistakable sound of machine gun fire echoed through the tunnel. I quickly ducked behind the nearest vehicle, resting the stock of my rifle on the ground and cautiously scanning ahead. That‚Äôs when I noticed the tunnel growing darker and darker, as though the headlights were being switched off. After watching for a moment, I realized the noise was coming from a mini gun, being aimed at the vehicles with their lights still on. Whoever was firing it was deliberately targeting people in their cars.  
  
The cars ahead of me soon realized they were being targeted and killed. It wasn‚Äôt long before every vehicle had turned off its headlights, leaving the muzzle flash of the minigun as the only source of light. At that point, I knew I had to stop this person. I moved cautiously, closing the distance to the minigun. When I was close enough, I could see clearly‚Äîit was a raptor operating the weapon. All I could make out was the beast‚Äôs silhouette, but for some reason, the hundreds of jagged teeth seemed to shimmer in the dark, grinning as though enjoying the onslaught. I stayed as low as possible, my rifle at the ready. The .22 might not have much stopping power, but it was better than nothing.

It felt like an eternity, but I finally reached the minigun‚Äîonly to find there was no raptor. As it turned out, the raptor had mounted the minigun and set it to fire so she could see, using it to hunt people in their cars. I could hear screams and the shattering of windows. Clever girl. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint where the raptor was, but I knew I only had so much time before the light ran out. I slowly made my way back to our truck. By the time I reached it, my wife had turned off our headlights too. I looked at her and said, ‚ÄúI love you, but I think we‚Äôre going to die here.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúI love you too, but thanks for the words of encouragement, Jesus!‚Äù Just then, I heard the raptor‚Äôs footsteps as the sound of the minigun stopped. It was pitch black. I fired a single shot toward the footsteps, and the muzzle flash lit up the raptor‚Äôs face as she crept closer, chirping softly. I fired the rest of my clip, then suddenly woke up, terrified, just before it seemed like I would have died.

1jno672,Dream that ruined my day,"My bf cheated on me with a prostitute.

I screamed at her that I want her to die.

I looked at my own reflection in the window. That wasn't me, I don't look like that in real life, but in this dream, that was me.

I suddenly had a gun in my hand, (never touched a gun in real life).

1jnuksj,"I dream of my pets and then the same night they die, why do they only appear once and it's at the night they died? Does anyone experience or know about this as well?","So, I don't really know how to explain it but the title says it all, I for some reason only dream of my pets once in my whole life, and it's at the night they passed, the thing is, I only had two pets I remember dying, and it was my dog and my cat, for my dog I knew he died, but for my cat I got the news after she died, since I was sleeping at that time. I'll just use an example of my cat since I didn't even know she was dead until she woke up, so it can't be anything about grief or such.

So, it was the night where I was at my grandparents' house for dinner, and when we left we all said what we thought would be our final goodbye, since our cat might not survive the night, and when we got back home I immediately got ready for bed, I was tired after a long day of worrying about my cat, school and helping my grandma prepare dinner, and when I fell asleep, I had a dream of both me and my cat laying on the double bed in my grandparents' bedroom, with her top half laying on my lap and her bottom half laying on the bed, and then she got up and started walking around the bed and wasn't limping, which was rather unusual, since she broke both of her back legs six years ago, and I remember just yelling something along the lines of ""Grandma! Katia (the name of my cat is Katia, btw.) is healthy again, I think!"" And then I ran out of the bedroom, and it was the end of the dream. Also a timeline reminder, it was during the dinner where my cat passed away, and the next day I wake up and immediately realized it's a dream, and it pretty much left me feeling even more worried and sad, and left me crying in bed, as I then sent a message to my grandma, asking if my cat is still alive or not. Which later on I already got the news that she passed after overhearing my parents talking about it, and then my dad came into my room to see me crying my eyes out since I heard it, and he just personally gave me the news and we buried her that day, where I didn't even want to go to an activity I love, and just come to bury her with my dad, sister and grandparents, while also venting to my grandma about the dream I had while my dad and grandpa were digging the grave and my sis was just walking around, and my grandma just told me that she probably came to say goodbye, which I should've expected, since she believes in the rainbow bridge and stuff like that, and I don't really know what to say other than that, that's the whole day since after that I was just laying in bed for the whole day, so nothing unusual happened there. So what does anyone think? Does anyone know what it's called, or the scientific definition of what it is? Or experienced it before? Since whenever I search it up it gives me stuff about dreaming of pets dying or that it's just grief and mourning, while in my case it isn't.",1,3

And then I wanted to document what was happening and what my dreams was about so I opened my phone and wrote down on my notes app about my dreams and then when I turned my phone off and ‚Äúwent back to sleep‚Äù I actually woked up . 

BUT the alarm thing was still real and like it was like my mind was still in the dream when my eyes were open and closed . It felt like I was awake while I was dreaming and my mind just went right back into the sencuero, like RIGHT AWAY, I didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúgo back to sleep‚Äù or anything like that . 



ALSO - everytime in having sleep paralisis it‚Äôs like my body is vibrating and I hear a buzzing sound and like my body is buzzing, is that normal? I also had a certain experience that was in my room while ‚Äúawake‚Äù or sleeping I don‚Äôt even know . 



I WOULD LOVE OTHERS OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS ON THIS!! ",3,1
1jnu7ki,Saw dead relatives in dream,"In the morning during 9am, i saw the bad dream. I saw my dead aunt, my father‚Äôs younger sister. She actually died 10 years ago in cancer. 

I heard the news she just died and ran into the house. When I went there I saw people are bringing the deadbody and i walked to see her. 
All amy family members were there too. My father was there too.  And i also someone else was also lying with her too and she was my father‚Äôs grandmother who actually died 15 years ago. 

But surprisingly I saw she was alive still like a dead body on the dead-bed, speaking moaning while dying Close to death. I was screaming and crying. I woke up with palpitation and crying, i felt like everything is happening live now. 

I watch this kind of dream often from past few years. What does it mean? And it feels like so real?

Anyways I keep having dreams where I‚Äôm seriously getting to know him and it feels so fucking real. Last night I had a dream about him again, I met his family, and his personality. I woke up feeling heartbroken.

I just want to know if this means anything from maybe a spiritual perspective or just a logical one. Any thoughts would be nice as well. Sorry bit of a boring post ",1,1
1jnpc8h,Encounter,"Although I hadn‚Äôt been to school in decades I was brought back to school at end of day. I go to get on a bus and they are all gone. I find out via other students that the bus loop is now somewhere else. I go to the location and I see the last one leaving. I decide to walk. I end up on a beach with many people and all the sudden a construction/billboard spawns on the beach and it starts conveying a message to me to pay attention. It tells me there is something sinister going on. At this time government officials start showing up and the billboard disappears but I can hear a voice in my head now telling me that it will be back and to meet them. I yell out where??? I don‚Äôt know where!! The voice tells me I will know when it comes time. The government officials have now taken keen notice to me and are heading in my direction. I make a run for it. 

A few seconds later a large black and white whale is seen breaching and heading directly at me diagonally to the shore line. It‚Äôs obvious that I am the target. The whale then starts a parallel path to the shore. This is what the billboard was referencing I knew. I grabbed onto the whale as it passed. It went a couple feet underwater for about 100 yards then went to surface again to allow me to breathe. Then dove again. It let me off back to the shore where I noticed an undercover agent. He gave chase. I went into a restroom where there was a homeless guy. I told him I was being chased and needed to hide. He recommended hiding under some sheets or towels after I dig a hole in the sand. I said thanks as I watched him take out a big roll of cash and start thumbing thru it. 

The agent was outside the bathroom which had an entry and exit door right next to each other. I tried to go out door number one as he was coming in door number two. He noticed. We did a Scooby-Doo shuffle back and forth between the doors before I took off outside. I ran for it again. I made it to the woods when I encountered a maintenance yard worker who appeared to be throwing flares into the surrounding woods. Some flares would light up and burn, others seemed delayed and or wouldn‚Äôt burn. I thought it odd. 

I kept running and made it to an office which turned out to be the undercover agents office. I saw his cellphone on the table and files pointing to the fact the flares were destroying the forest so they could build there due to a loophole of sorts. This all clicked in my head as to why the billboard /whale appeared to tell me of this destruction of land. Just then I heard the agents coming. I crawled under desk to get away and my foot caught on the cellphone cord making a crashing sound. Agents rushed in chasing me. I fought them. And ran. They gave chase. I fought again putting one down and the next I put a jacket over my leg and told the agent to look the cool jacket. He bent over to look and I kneed him in the face to get away. Dream over. ",2,2

1jmnx7c,I Had a Dream Encounter With 3 Beings‚ÄîIt Felt Like More Than Just a Dream,"Last night, I had what felt like a profound dream experience that‚Äôs been sitting with me heavy in the best way. I‚Äôm not sure if I can even call it ‚Äújust a dream‚Äù, the feeling, the clarity, and the energy behind it felt different, like it was real on another level. This was the first time I‚Äôve ever seen beings like this in any of my dreams or experiences, and I think it might connect to some of the other encounters I‚Äôve shared before, especially my past abduction dream where I felt calm being pulled up into a craft.

In this recent dream, I was outside climbing underneath what looked like metal bleachers, the kind you‚Äôd find near a field. I don‚Äôt know exactly where I was, it didn‚Äôt feel familiar at all except for the bleachers themselves. As I moved underneath them and climbed up the side, I suddenly came face-to-face with three beings sitting just above me. They were elevated a bit, kind of looking down at me, and I was beneath them at an angle.

The moment I saw them, I said ‚Äúhey‚Äù out loud, naturally, like I had met them before, like there was familiarity. It wasn‚Äôt forced or nervous. It felt mutual. They didn‚Äôt respond verbally, but they looked at me, then looked around, and then at each other. It was like they were checking the space around us, or maybe scanning for something. I felt locked into their attention, not in a threatening way, just‚Ä¶ focused.

Then, the being closest to me, on my right, reached out and gently touched the right side of my head, right around my temple near my eye. The second it made contact, I instantly felt and heard this strong buzzing or frequency sound. But it wasn‚Äôt just a sound, I felt it inside my head. It was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced in waking life. Not painful, not overwhelming, just powerful and undeniably real. It made my eyes close automatically, and I felt something happening internally that‚Äôs hard to explain. And then‚Ä¶ I woke up.

The beings had grayish skin and were wearing fitted black clothing or robes that weren‚Äôt baggy. Their faces are hard to describe, almost like they were constantly melting or rippling, shifting in ways I‚Äôve never seen before. It was strange, but it didn‚Äôt scare me. The one that touched me with its finger grinned as it was bending over to touch me, in that moment there were no words, as soon as I seen it grin before it touched me I had this feeling of ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna be okay, you‚Äôre ready‚Äù, I felt seen and safe in that moment.

Since waking up, I haven‚Äôt been able to shake the feeling. I still remember the sound, the sensation, the way they looked at me like they knew me. I wonder if that ‚Äúhey‚Äù I said was instinctual because on some level, I do know them. I even feel like I might‚Äôve heard a ‚Äúhey‚Äù back, not spoken aloud, but inside my head, telepathically. The energy between us wasn‚Äôt hostile. It was calm. Curious. Intentional.

I‚Äôve had experiences before, UFO sightings, abduction dreams, but this one stood out. It was deeply sensory, subtle but powerful. I‚Äôm curious what others think this could mean. Was it just a dream, or something more? 

I tried to generate an image using AI to get as close as possible to how they look, the image above is the most accurate I could get it. ",713,94
1jnonen,The Old Dream,"When I was 21 years old, I had a dream that has stayed with me in such vivid detail that it has always felt more like a memory of a movie I‚Äôve seen or a book I‚Äôve read.

This dream was in fact two dreams which came to me over two consecutive nights. 

Night 1‚Ä¶

It is mid afternoon. I am alone in a very old, very deep forest. Trees of almost unbelievable size and age surround me. Some are entirely overgrown with the vine known as kudzu, creating an array of massive, organic statues. 

It is beautiful, a magical place whose power is evident. I am also aware that it is not a safe place to be alone after dark. There are nocturnal predators who I know will be hunting once the sun sets. And this relates to the  final piece of information that I begin the dream possessing. I am there in the forest for a specific reason, which is to find my lost ‚Äúpartner.‚Äù

What that means specifically - who this partner actually is- I do not know when the dream begins. But every fiber of my being is aware that my survival depends on finding this lost partner.

All day long, I walk through the forest. Hours pass, searching to no avail. Often, I want to stop and take in the astonishing beauty of the forest but I chastise myself to ‚ÄúStop daydreaming. The mission is all that matters.‚Äù

It grows later and later, and the sun is beginning to set. The light is becoming slowly but perceptibly dimmer. The shadows are growing, and with them my sense of urgency. Just before sunset, I see a light in the distance. Filled with hope that this is the clue I have searched for, I start walking quickly toward the light.

It‚Äôs a home, humble but projecting a feeling of warmth, safety, family. I walk around to the back of the house where I see a barn. The door to it is partly open and I walk toward it with a growing feeling of excitement.

When I reach the door and look inside, I see a large, male, black Labrador Retriever. My heart swells with joy! This is the partner I have been so desperate to find! He runs to me and remembering the feeling of that reunion brings tears to my eyes to this day. Few moments of my waking life have come close to matching the pure joy - the bliss! - of that reunion.

And the joy grows even greater when I look to the back of the barn and see a female Golden Lab who is lying down, nursing a litter of black and golden pups! 

I look back to my partner. By what seems to be a kind of telepathy, I say to him, ‚ÄúAh ha! So that‚Äôs why you left! Now I understand completely!‚Äù

He is so proud of his new family, and I am filled with a sense of the most perfect love for him that I have ever known. Also by means of telepathy, he tells me that he‚Äôs ready to leave with me now if that‚Äôs what I want and need. With no small amount of sadness, I tell him, ‚ÄúNo. This is your place now. That‚Äôs your family. She‚Äôs your partner.‚Äù

We both know it‚Äôs true, and as much joy as this scene brings us both, there is also the pain of knowing that the time has come for us to part ways. I walk out of the barn with him following close behind me.

Outside, the family who lives in the house has emerged. They smile when they see me, seeming to understand who I am through the connection they have formed with my partner. I tell them that he will be attached to them now, and they are lucky to have such an amazing, faithful new family member.

They  tell me that I am welcome to stay too. I explain that I can‚Äôt, that my work lies on the far side of the forest and is too vital to ignore. They insist that I should stay the night at the very least because of the dangers out there in the dark. It is a very tempting offer, but I know that I can‚Äôt accept it. Whatever awaits me out there in the dark, it is imperative that I face it. It‚Äôs as if all the world depends on this moment, this choice.

After a tearful goodbye with my old friend and my new ones, I head back into the woods. As the light of the house fades ever farther into the distance, the light of the setting sun also grows dimmer and dimmer. Soon, night has fallen. 

And I am becoming more and more aware that I am not alone. Whatever dangers, whatever predators call this forest home are now out there. They have my scent. I‚Äôm now being hunted and I know it. 

I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm hopelessly outnumbered. The way back is blocked by the hunters. The way forward leads only deeper into an ever darker forest. But it‚Äôs the only way left to go. 

I hear them now, closer and closer. Though it seems an almost pointless effort, I do the one and only thing I can do.

I run.

‚Ä¶End of Night 1‚Ä¶

Night 2‚Ä¶
I run.

Through the dark forest, with the hunters closing in on me faster and faster, I run. I know it‚Äôs hopeless. They will catch me. They could overtake me any time they wanted to. They‚Äôre just toying with me now, playing with their food. They chase me. And I do the only thing I can do. I run and I keep running, never looking back.

Ahead of me, I see light. I don‚Äôt know what its source is but it doesn‚Äôt matter. It looks like hope. I‚Äôm running out of energy, of time. But perhaps if I can reach whatever the source of that light is I‚Äôll be safe. 

It seems so far away, and that I can‚Äôt possibly reach the light before the hunters take me down. One step at a time, I run for the light.

And just as I reach the light, I stumble and fall. Instinctively, I put my arms over my head and shut my eyes tightly, fully expecting to be overrun and ripped apart. But it doesn‚Äôt happen. Slowly I open my eyes. I lift my head.

The light is coming from the full moon high overhead, reflecting off of an open sky expanse of low, rolling hills. All across,, as far as the distant horizon, the land is covered by a blanket of pristine snow.

And as I lift my head to take in the white vastness before me, I find myself eye to eye with a large, white wolf who looks at me with an expression that quite clearly asks, ‚ÄúWhat in the world are you doing out here alone?‚Äù

My heart burst with joy! ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù I think. ‚ÄúI have a new partner!‚Äù

But as formidable as my new friend is, I can‚Äôt help but realize that even with him by my side we are still hopelessly outnumbered. Seeming to understand my worries, the wolf looks at me as if to say, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, do you?‚Äù

He turns his head to look at the snow covered, rolling hills behind him, and I look too.

And in that moment, I see the most astonishing sight I‚Äôve ever seen in any dream, any waking moment, any movie, any story. The snow covered land stands up! 

It is a sea of white wolves‚Ä¶

A moment later, the hunters break the line of the forest too. The wolves don‚Äôt snarl, or bark, they don‚Äôt bare their teeth. They just turn to look at the hunters. And the. hunters, seeing that it is actually they who are vastly outnumbered, retreat very, very slowly, and vanish back into the shadows of the dark forest.

I stand, awed by the discovery that I do not have just a new partner. I have an ocean of partners.

I walk out into their midst, my hands stoking the snow white fur on their backs and heads. As I walk deeper into their seemingly endless ranks, I look up at the moon overhead. With every step, the brilliant white light of the moon, of the wolves, of the entire world, all blend into a single light. 

With every step, I become one with the light.

I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs resurfacing now in my dreams but they are now causing me anxiety day to day.

1jnsg0t,Unsettling dreams for a clairvoyant,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short and avoid too many details, but some of my family members has a spiritual gift‚Äîwe see dreams of future events. (I hope this community is open to these kinds of experiences.) However, our dreams usually need to be interpreted to understand their meaning. Unlike the rest of my family, I sometimes dream of actual future events as if I‚Äôm watching a recorded video. For context, we typically only see events related to ourselves or people we know‚Äînothing on a national or global scale.

This is the second time I‚Äôve had a dream so disturbing that I woke up with my heart pounding. I hate gore, I don‚Äôt watch horror movies, and I avoid viral gore content. If you‚Äôre sensitive to that kind of thing, you may want to stop reading‚ÄîI‚Äôll try to leave out the worst parts.

In my dream, I saw a young man waiting for his turn in some kind of live event. There were people commenting, and he looked terrified about what was going to happen next. When he realized he might get kicked from the live, he quickly pointed his camera toward his bed. (I remember a window behind him, and it was still light outside.) He climbed onto the bed, put a gun to his right temple, and pulled the trigger. The way he dropped, the blood pooling on the windowsill, the look on his face‚Äîit was too real. And coming from someone who has never seen something like that in real life, it felt unsettlingly vivid.

1jnsfbt,Weird violent dream,"I was at some kind of pool party in someone's backyard when two other guests suddenly went berserk and started unaliving people with pew pews. In a split-second decision, I played dead. But as soon as the screaming and gunshots stopped, I felt them pouring gasoline over everyone‚Äîand then they lit the bodies on fire.

As soon as they turned around, I got up, grabbed them so they would catch fire too, then tore off my shirt and ran away. But out of nowhere, a starving, malnourished-looking tiger lunged at me. I punched it and kept running.

I made it to a hotel or convention center, where I found two people on the first floor. One being especially aggressive towards me. They thought I was one of the crazies, so I assumed the chaos was happening everywhere. In an attempt to possibly gain asylum by trading, I told them, ""I have a granola bar! I'm not one of the crazies!""

They took me to the top floor, where others were hiding, but the people there were fearful and didn‚Äôt trust me. Tension rose quickly, and they turned violent‚Äîuntil they killed me. I can't remember exactly why but I think they used their ""fear"" as an excuse to just unalive me for consumption. Last thing I remember was basically being shoved by the group against a giant dining hall table and one of them had machete or axe, and started whacking

1jnj8yl,Can u tell me about this dream? I am confused,"A long time ago, I had a dream that left a deep impression on me. In this dream, I found myself standing in the middle of a vast, endless grassland. The grass was short and green, stretching infinitely in all directions, with no hills, trees, or any other structures‚Äîjust an open, peaceful landscape. Above me, the sky was completely clear, without a single cloud. The atmosphere felt still, silent, and mysterious.

In the center of this grassland stood a lone white house. It was built of what seemed like marble, though I‚Äôm not completely sure. The house had a pure, almost divine presence, standing alone in this infinite space.

Inside the house, there was an apple tree, and I could see apples growing on its branches. But the tree wasn‚Äôt freely accessible‚Äîit was enclosed within a transparent glass case, as if it were being protected or preserved for some reason.

I also remember seeing a person sitting inside the house. However, I couldn't see his face. He wasn‚Äôt speaking or doing anything‚Äîjust sitting there, still and silent. His presence felt mysterious yet peaceful, as if he was meant to be there, watching over the tree.

At some point, I asked him, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù But he did not respond. He remained silent and still, as if my question didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîor as if the answer was something I wasn‚Äôt ready to know. A strange fear crept over me, as if I was approaching something unknown, something beyond my understanding.

Even though this dream happened years ago, I still remember it vividly. It felt meaningful, almost as if it held a message or a hidden truth. Since then, I have never seen that tree, that house, or that person again in any of my dreams. And yet, I still think about it, wondering what it meant.",3,4

1jnqhz5,I have no way to preface this..,"A Grand Realization

First Corinthians 13:13 says 
‚ÄúAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.‚Äù 

I preface this with that invaluable statement because I believe I‚Äôve had a grand realization in the form of a dream given to me by our Holy Father The Lord God. 

At around 3:30PM on March 30th 2025,  I laid my head down to rest in my comfortable bed, I had had some trouble falling asleep, but eventually I awoke. 

My dream started how they always do, some weird visuals and irrational situations, but then I was teleported so to speak into my moms car somewhere in what I believe to be before late July in 2025. 

I was in there, talking to my cousin, Paul, who lived with us at the time when I realized where I was. I explained to avail that I was from the future, maybe even from another universe. Mom and Paul accepted this as truth when I told one of my neighbors who was just now moving in everything I knew about them. Things I could only know if I had been their friend for multiple years. 

My neighbor, who in my universe is a good friend of mine, was astonished and then asked what I was doing here, to which I replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got no idea how I‚Äôm here, but I think I have a purpose. 

I asked to go inside my house to alert my entire family, which happened to be there for some sort of gathering, my niece and nephew were younger, everyone was, by about 2 years. Once I told my family proof that I was from the future(besides my now much bigger stature and slight facial hair) they we‚Äôre astounded and I kept telling them things that would happened or have happened in the future, or maybe the universe I was from. My brother was sitting in our recliner, my sister was on the couch, with an empty space between her and another woman I couldn‚Äôt totally identify. I sat with my sister, sharing experiences with her and relating to her, being now older and having slightly more life experience, everyone treated me as such, and I felt at home, something I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time. I kept feeling this profound since of love and affection radiating from all the members of my family, my sisters hand on my hand on top of my thigh, my brothers laughter filling the room, etc. I was experiencing what I can only explain as peak life, even for just as short of a time as 10 minutes, I didn‚Äôt want to leave. I even remember feeling my present self trying to get me to come back, maybe trying to retrieve my soul from this other dimension and back to my real body. Whatever it was, I ignored it, cherishing every single second of this wonderful time back. 

The reason I loved this so much is because without going into too much detail, my family life somewhat fell apart after July of 2023, and I suppose my heart yearned for one last glimpse of familial peace, perfection in its truest form, love. 

After this dream, i awoke now flooded with feelings of love, affection, and happiness, understanding that my biggest want in my life is to be with my family, happy and content. Money, riches, fame, or glory mean little to me now, just 30 minutes later, I feel as if I‚Äôve been chasing gratification from the wrong things.

Family is beautiful, and it‚Äôs not something everyone gets to experience, and it‚Äôs not something everyone gets to fully keep, in my case. I believe whatever is out there, call it God if you want, sent me this dream to wake me up(ironic), allowing me to experience true love once again, but this time, letting me see that it was much more beautiful than I ever would have thought 2 years ago.

I leave you, the reader with this, never EVER miss the opportunity to tell a loved one how much you love them. Never pass up the chance to do something special for your family members and close friends. 

Our argent asset is our time, and I am ashamed to admit that I wasted two years not even thinking about home I was wasting the endless love my family offered me, but now it all makes sense, I‚Äôd die for my family, and I truly feel for those who haven‚Äôt experienced a love like this.

If you‚Äôre reading this, take this as a sign to never take love for granted, whether it be a partner, a family member, or a friend. Love is something special, something that isn‚Äôt supposed to be taken lightly or unseriously. It‚Äôs to be respected and cherished. 

I‚Äôll close with my opening, because I believe that the Bible sums it up perfectly even if you aren‚Äôt religious.

First corinthians 13:13 says 
‚ÄúAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.‚Äù (NIV)

The greatest emotion, be it not euphoria, be it not drunkenness, or any other temporary feeling‚Äî is love.",1,0
1jnlcss,I dreamt of a cold case,"I‚Äôm not one who dreams very understandable dreams most of the time and even when I do it‚Äôs weird, but I just had a dream that was clear as day and it freaked me out. 

I don‚Äôt really remember what my role in the dream was but it revolved around the mysterious disappearance of a woman a few years earlier in what became a cold case. At first I got a feeling of what happened but didn‚Äôt understand it, and then I saw a higlight of the case on the TV (I think it was the anniversary of the woman‚Äôs disappearance) and I was immediately reminded in an aha moment, like it was super famous a few years ago and then nothing came of it and I then remembered it. 

As to what the disappearance was actually like, and this is where it gets a little creepy: the woman was supposed to take a train like many others in a small town/village in what I think was germany/austria/central Europe, because it was a holiday (easter I think), but for whatever reason she didn‚Äôt get on the train. She then talked to an unknown man and got into his red car and they then drove away. Not too long after, the man returned to the town to get something and then disappeared. After that the woman was never seen again and the man remained unidentified. I think the leading theory was that the woman had problems with her train ticket and the man offered her a ride and somehow convinced her to go with him.

In the dream as I was listening to the case details on the TV, it was as if I saw ghostly shapes of the train, the woman, the man and his car and all that happened. Other than the man and woman, there were lots of people about, also ghostly shapes, probably because of the holiday. The ghostly shapes were colored but pale and made of mist. As I recalled the case and saw all this it was as if something dawned on me in the dream but I can‚Äôt recall what the greater context of the dream was, nor my role in it. I think I may have been haunted by the womans ghost but idk. The whole part about the case was scarily vivid and detailed and it gives me the chills just thinking about it. I‚Äôve briefly looked around now for any real world case that matches the details of the one in the dream but so far I haven‚Äôt found any. Parts of me hope it is completely false because it would be insanely creepy if it was a real world thing but another part of me feels like it is and it intrigues me.

Has anyone else had dreams like this that creepes you out to the point that you need to look over your shoulder now and then? I‚Äôm not the superstitious type but something really feels off about all this.

Tl;dr: I dreamt of a women who didn‚Äôt get on a train and then got into a strange mans car who then drove off. The man breifly returned to the town before disappearing again. The man remained unidentified and the woman was never seen again.",2,0
1jn6o9v,This may sound pathetic but I just had to share with someone,"So recently my life has been kind of in shambles. Had to move in with my sister in a room above her garage. No job, no direction really, just kind of taking it day by day. 

  
In college, I had a girlfriend who I loved, really the only person I've really loved romantically. There's a lot of complicated history with our break up but I thought I moved on from it. But last night, I had this amazing dream where we were back together. Not in a happy go lucky way but in a very real relationship type of way if that makes sense. 

  
That was almost 24 hours ago and if you had asked me 48 hours ago, I would've told you I was completely over her but after that dream, all I want to do is just to have it again. To be as happy as I was for what seemed like those two minutes. ",22,6

A few weeks before that I had a dream about me walking between the highest of skyscrapers but they where all filled with blood that spilled slightly out of the windows. I walked down the street and suddenly the windows all burst and flood the street. An immense volume  a Tsunami of blood engulfed the streets and me and I could not stay afloat.

To start, i have a severe depression. basically i wanted to die so bad, but i don't have the fucking balls to do it.

before i had this dream,i was really on my lowest point of my life where i was ready to end everything.

i dreamed about taking my own life, it was successful, i finally had the guts to end all my suffering.
and when i thought i was finally free from everything

i saw my dead self

 i attended my own funeral

i remember just standing there in front of my body, staring at it. seeing my dead self freaked the hell out of me. heck yeah it's creepy as fuck.

i saw everyone crying.

the love ones i left behind, the pain you feel knowing you can't go back and undo the things you've done.

Then someone told me it was time to go.
i remember we're in this black car, it was like a ride to the after life type of shit.

i was in the back seat, and the guy was driving. he was wearing black.

i told him that i wasn't ready yet, that i wanted to go back and live again. i was crying and begging him to stop and turn around.

i was not ready yet. something inside me wants to let go, but a part of me is saying "" i havent live my life yet""

i remember him saying, ""You need to move on,  and forgive yourself for what happenned""

I'm having trouble describing the song too. Imagine someone playing blues guitar similar to ""The Sound of Silence"", but singing like stereotypical Egyptian music from movies.

1jnidxi,Dreamt that I had a therapist who used Balatro as a way to explain therapy concepts/techniques to me,"Prefacing this with I don‚Äôt remember shit about what actually happened, just the general setting and plot points.

I got assigned to a new therapist for whatever reason at the start of my dream, so I had to go in for a session with my mom. The entire office was dingy and had a blue tinge to it. There were two crying boys waiting in the reception room, and the actual receptionist was a mildly creepy looking guy who then directed me towards the actual therapist‚Äôs room. Her room was had the same vibe as the outside, and held a large table in the middle of the room, a bunch of chairs labeled with a/b indicating where the patient and therapist could sit (but this just led to every chair having a/b on it), and a small table and chair set up in the corner of the room. What made it feel.. creepier? was the fact that one of the walls was fully made of glass, like one of those extremely corporate offices. Anyways, the setup in the corner was for the therapist‚Äôs assistant, and he just chimed in every so often. I can‚Äôt actually remember anything said here except ‚Äúnice to see someone not in distress‚Äù from the assistant. Then, we transitioned over to an outside area that looked really nice, and honestly the opposite ambiance of the office. The therapist then pulled out a poster board, the type you‚Äôd see in a science fair, with the Balatro shop layout on it. But, instead of the things you‚Äôd expect on it, it was therapy terms like cbt or dbt. She then explained all of them in Balatro terms or using Balatro references, such as turning the scary face joker into a happy face one. She was also German for some reason. ",2,1
1jnn79w,Dreamt my soul watched my body be eaten alive and dismembered. Purgatory? Hell?,"I had a really strange dream. It started with that I had to give a class presentation, kind of like show and tell. The day of the presentation, the school administration came in to tell us our teacher had died. We still gave the presentation anyway. One of the girls in my class gave a presentation on a plant whose roots ‚Äúwalk‚Äù or ‚Äúmove.‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember in detail what my presentation was about only that it had something to do with geography.

All of a sudden, everyone from the class was no longer in the classroom. We were in a type of large, open air facility with a lot of plants and ponds. It had a wire gate around. It seemed like a place where they would keep large animals at the zoo. We couldn‚Äôt escape from it. In this place, people‚Äôs thoughts would become true. For example, there was a young boy with cat ears and small wings, and the girl‚Äôs plant was here with her too. I don‚Äôt remember what my thoughts were creating‚Ä¶

With time and everyone‚Äôs thoughts, the animals in the facility were starting to become very wild. I was standing near pond and started to hear and see crocodiles coming towards me. I started running away. I get to a type of log that had a human-animal like creature hiding behind it. I am scared. Suddenly, what I imagine was an angel came by and grabbed me. More like, she pulled my soul from my body but I didn‚Äôt realize it at the moment and just kept running behind her. Then, from what seems like higher above and far away, I see my body still behind the log. An animal pulls up to it and bites my left boob off. Then the human-animal like creature and the new animal start violently eating and dismembering my body. I died but I just kept fleeing.

Trying to process what had just happened, I suddenly find myself back inside the facility. The angel was no longer there. However all my classmates were there and they had all died as well. I asked them, aren‚Äôt we supposed to go somewhere? Like Heaven or something? They didn‚Äôt reply. Suddenly the plant girl and another guy started chasing me, kind of bullying me or trying or hurt me. I realized I still felt like myself but something was different‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt figure out what it was. Then, I threw some electric shock bolts on them (don‚Äôt know where I got them) and started electrocuting them. I realized what was different about me. I was inflicting pain on them and I liked it‚Ä¶ they started laughing. Then the three of us started having s*x.

After this I remembered, ‚Äúoh I used to be married!‚Äù and proceeded to call my living husband on the phone. I told him I missed him and wanted to see him. I was trying to seduce him. I can‚Äôt recall how much time I had been in the facility at that point. He only said ‚Äúnice try Diddy‚Äù because he remembered that I had died and he had already had a funeral for me. After this I woke up.

1jnbye8,I fell to my death,"I just woke up from this crazy ass dream.

It all seemed so real like I did not think I was dreaming at all. 

I‚Äôm driving on the road in the mountains. I‚Äôm going up this hill. I‚Äôm in like a wooded area with tall green trees around me and it‚Äôs like real foggy misty. Imagine the PNW. It‚Äôs gloomy out. It‚Äôs not sunny. It‚Äôs not dark. It‚Äôs really gloomy and grey and foggy out, and it comes to where I‚Äôm going up like a mountain and comes a bend in the road like a curve, and the trees start disappearing so the bend is just wide open, like it‚Äôs just a drop off a cliff and there‚Äôs no guard rails. and I‚Äôm just driving and I remember seeing the bend come up and thinking I gotta slow down, and I go to step on the brakes slow down or let up from the gas to slow down and next thing you know - and it just happened so fast, the car just like fish tail spin out, and I just flew off the side of the cliff. 

It happened so fast and I was thinking so fast like my thoughts are running like they just went through my mind in like a nanosecond and I can‚Äôt remember which thought was the first thought first cause they act like they all hit me at the same exact time. and I remember thinking no oh shit like that Didn‚Äôt really just happened!

I‚Äôm not ready to die! and then I was like am I dead yet? like I physically felt the sensation of falling & spinning! Everything went black.

1jngo2u,Someone please explain this,"Hello everyone.

Today I went for a trip to Germany with one of my friends. The trip usually takes 12 hours by car, so I drove the first 6 and a half hours then I switched with my friend. (That night I slept for 4 hours, as I couldnt fall asleep.)

We switched seats and I decided to take a nap. I covered myself with my jacket and I fell asleep. This is where it got strange.

I dreamt of being in a car with that same friend, he was driving me on the autobahn. In my body I felt like we were driving 300kmh. (like really insanely fast) The strange thing is that I was fully aware that I was dreaming but the problem is I couldnt wake myself up, no matter how much I tried. I was so scared that I tried to talk to my friend in my dream. I was trying to say to him: ""I.... caaaant.... waaaake...uppp."" - but I said that so softly he couldnt hear me, so I was trying to say it few more times. (Remember, this was all in my dream.) I was also feeling dehydrated, then I tried to ask him to wake me up, but I couldnt. The dream felt like it lasted days. Then, all of a sudden, I gather all my strenght and finally manage to open my eyes. (I opened my eyes by force, I wanted to wake up from that dream.) I woke up like scared like sh*t and like a dead man in a movie that gasps for air and then sits like a mummy. The first thing I asked my friend was: ""Did I just talk to you?"" He laughed and said ""No, what do you mean?"" and laughed.

1jnkhjl,How do I keep my dreams from affecting day-to-day life?,"I'm a very vivid dreamer, most of the time they're grounded in reality and I am interacting with friends/family/coworkers in places familiar to me. Sometimes they almost seem real. When I wake up its very clear that it was a dream, but I find myself sometimes getting lost when it comes to how I interact with those who have shown up in dreams before.

A great example of this is a few days ago I dreamt I was out to dinner with some friends from work. It got kinda funky (as it usually does) when every time I tried to pay the bill the amount changed, or I just couldn't quite grab the right card from my wallet. However, I still had great conversations with some people from work that I've only chatted with briefly. In those conversations I felt like we were becoming better friends, and I learned more about them. When I see them in person however, the personality I had attributed to them in my head is just not reality (duh, it was in my head).

I'm honestly getting sick and tired of my dreams doing this, especially as the more they happen the harder it can be to keep my expectations grounded in reality. The dreams felt so real, but they weren't. It doesn't help that most nights when I dream like this I wake up feeling that I'm physically rested but mentally exhausted.

1jnf1vp,I have never once cared to remember or write down a dream...until this morning,"Dreams have never really had an impact on me. I cant remember any dream I've ever had and I've never been bothered by it. I've never thought of dreams being signs or manifestations for me. On the bright side, I've never remembered some horrible nightmares I've had, and i know i've had some bad ones. I woke up this morning from a dream that I remember so vividly.

A little preface about me, I'm not sure its relevant or not. I am a 26 year old single dad. I'm a licensed electrician that works on a Government contract. I'm in decent shape and I am moderately healthy. Growing up, I've always admired the idea of love. From 3rd grade on, I've always had a romantic mind set and I have been a lover. I was always searching for love in ""crushes"" and I never had any idea what love was. My first serious relationship (or strong feeling of love towards someone) was my senior year of high school. I was best friends with this girl who I ended up falling in love with. I was a varsity football player and she was a varsity cheerleader. In the back of my mind I've always had an admiration for this previous relationship of mine. I'm sure its rooted in growing up seeing movie and fairytale depictions of ""Love"". Outside of that, she gave me some of the important firsts. Firsts that make you feel a certain euphoria. I can remember the warm feeling I got when I wrapped my arm around her, the exciting feeling I got when i stared into her eyes, the feeling of fireworks when I kissed her. It was my first relationship as a young man. It didnt last long but thats besides the point. At 19 I met my first true love, who is also my first true heart break. To make a long story short, we went from being young and in love and having 10x the feelings i previously described about my senior year girlfriend, to planning a wedding, to having my beautiful daughter. But as anyone knows, strong feelings of love come with strong feelings of heartbreak. Heartbreak that i would prefer not to live through again.

On to the main point of my post, the dream.

This dream was very short and very vague. But i cant really describe how its making me feel even after being awake from it for so long. The dream started in this sort of dark resort inside of a cave. I can see waterfalls and people around swimming. There is those foldable pool chairs that you see at many pools. I find myself sitting on one of the chairs drinking something. Along comes this girl who then sits on my lap. We cuddle up on the chair and she falls asleep in my arms. The dream then cuts to a field with a lot of my closest family and friends. I'm introducing her to all of them and she is showing off a ring on her hand. Two figures emerge from the field who end up being her parents. The dream ends as I wake up.

Im writing this because of what I am feeling after being awake. When I first woke up, I was angry because I never really saw her face. I know she was about 5'7"" because she was standing next to me. She had an athletic build and I believe she was Pacific Islander. This wasnt a sexual dream and her build and skin complexion are the only things I saw. I sit here confused because in that small and vague dream, I am awake almost ""re-feeling"" all of those first euphoria's i described in the preface. After my last relationship with my daughters mom, I have taken a break from dating or seeing anyone. I tell people its to focus on my daughter, but part of it is because im scared to love again. This girl in my dream, that i have never met, has giving me this feeling of true love i have felt before. You may read this and think ""C'mon man, it was 5 minute dream and you never saw her face."" I know... I cant really describe why its giving me these familiar feelings.

If you read this whole thing, thank you. If you're a dream expert, tell me if this means anything. If you're my english teacher from high school, I apologize for any grammatical errors. I ended up working construction and going to trade school instead of college. If you're my coworkers, just know ill still kick your ass even if i feel softy lovey feelings. If you're the girl in my dreams, please let me know. I'm ready to love again...but only for you.",2,1

1jnk4ai,Have you ever had a dream where your SO cheated then woke up mad?,"A little backstory before the dream: Me and my baby momma aren't together and haven't been for 7 years at least. But we've been single together for that time. We hate eachother with a passion and neither of us have moved on so we dance around eachother constantly. (Its far more toxic than it sounds) 



Now the dream: I was driving her to an appointment for what I thought was a repair shop for a car but when we get there we end up in this confusing maze in the style of a mall, she seems to know where she's going and what she's doing so I just follow. Till she suddenly says to me that she's actually there to sign up for a fight (she's never fought a day in her life) I'm wildly curious so I say I'm coming to watch. Except one of the people there distracted me with something unimportant and before I could break away from him she was gone, lead away by another guy who she said was a manager. So I run after where I thought she went and can't find her..  what's worse is the rooms I looked in weren't for fighters they were film studios for adult films... so I start panicking and get jerked awake.. I feel so hopeless.. and disgusted.. and ashamed.. I'm going after this post to pick her up from work, I am genuinely afraid I'll be angry with her for something she didn't do. ",1,0

Here‚Äôs where it gets weird (diagram below for clarity): My mirror was set on my desk leaned against the wall. There are misc items set in front of it (makeup, perfume, etc)- and about a foot of space between the mirror and the edge of the desk. If it had simply slid off, it would have knocked everything on there on the floor. These items were pretty much undisturbed. The kicker is, the mirror landed face up. This means it lifted off the desk, did a flip, and landed. 

To make things weirder, I have a medium sized statue of Guanyin (Bodhisattva of compassion) by my door. She was placed with her back to the wall, and is now about a foot out and turned. 

I‚Äôm extremely spiritual, and have had a number of unexplainable experiences- but nothing quite like this. If anyone has any insight as to what this may mean- please let me know. It would be much appreciated. ",1,6
1jnhlts,Disruptive PTSD dreams,"I have PTSD from childhood trauma. I use Marijuana nightly to help myself not have horrific vivid almost lucid dreams that put me back in the middle of the abuse I experienced as a child. This works really well for me and has for years. No dreams when I sleep stoned. I am getting job at a hospital and I have to do a drug test. I have not been smoking for a over a week now and have been having dreams again that make me not want to sleep at all and make me very useless during the day because little to not sleep at night.
I have done years of therapy that has helped with daytime functioning and I hate the way prescription medication makes me feel and they dont keep me from dreaming. If anyone has any suggestions I'd be very grateful.",1,0

1jnh4hn,What does my dream me?,So over the last 2 weeks I've had 2 dreams that seem to be a little similar and I don't know what they mean. Okay so the first is when I am falling asleep as I drift to sleep my body began to feel as if I'm swaying under water and I would feel scared so I would force myself awake and when I went to tell my mom I realized I never woke up and it was like a never ending loop of me continuing to try and avoid the swaying feeling but I couldn't. The other one I just had was while I was sleeping something was pulling at me but it wasn't exactly physically pulling me it felt more like energy and I couldn't move the half of my body being pulled and when I tried and turn away from it it would continue to pull me and it was a strange sensation in my body. Idk what they could mean all I know is they scare me lol,1,2
1jngzo8,help me interpret please,"So this dream happens on early January, when i recently broke up with my ex. i still remember every moment in that dream.

the dream:
(early morning) i and her sit on a public chair on road side. we joking with each other, she gently bites my hand, and i pinch her side belly. maybe i pinch way harder, and she got mad at me.

suddenly, she saw a white dog across the street. she cross the street to come to that dog. i just stand by watching her from the other side of the street. the dog seems so friendly, young, has a white fur, like a puddle but white. but the size of the dog is very big, like human size.

i feel bad about that dog, but my ex still playing around with that dog, and suddenly the dog is disappear for a while. i thought the dog was going to it mom, bcs it looks so young. but suddenly the dog run with high speed to her, like a bull running. 

i yelled at her, asked her to run, and she run. i immediately cross the road and try to intercept that dog. but i didnt success. that very big dog still chase my ex.

finally, that dog did hit my ex so bad. my ex bounced off the wall so hard, even i saw a crack on the wall. that dog still trying to hurt and bite her. in this moment, idk if she is alive or not.

1jngrxi,Had a Nightmare where I was blackmailed into covering up my own father‚Äôs murder,"For some context, my mom isn‚Äôt my biological mom, but she adopted me and my dad is my biological father.

In this dream, my dad had been missing for a week and I was struggling to cope with it. Just before he left I had heard him tell me that he loved me and would be back, but never returned that night. My mom was acting strangely after his disappearance and hadn‚Äôt said much or even reacted, just going to search groups to look for him. I thought maybe it was just how she was coping, but it felt too off for it to be natural. A few days had passed and I was feeling more helpless and already mourning because I could feel in the pit of my stomach that he probably wasn‚Äôt alive. One night I went on a ride along with my mom because I wanted to keep looking for my dad and she pulled over out in front of some woods before telling me that she killed my dad. I didn‚Äôt know how to react other than trying to escape immediately and she locked the doors, telling me that she planted some of my dna evidence that would incriminate me if I told anyone and I‚Äôd be seen as the murderer or her accomplice. I felt hopeless and completely lost, only grieving harder because there was a confirmation that my fears were right. I had to help her cover up things she left behind over the next few weeks while there were still search parties on going. 

I visited my grandparents‚Äô a while later and I feel terrible seeing them grieve while I stood there knowing what happened and was helping cover it up. It got to be too much and everything felt so surreal from the devastation I felt to the emptiness and disassociation I experienced while getting rid of evidence. I only woke up after I was standing in the middle of my room with a rope, planning to end it because the guilt and depression of the situation overtook me.

I have a lot of strange and symbolic dreams/nightmares, but rarely do I experience one that‚Äôs so dark and vivid that I wake up actually thinking it happened for a moment. 

Does this have meaning or am I looking too deep into it?",1,2
1jngqu1,The weirdest dream i‚Äôve ever had,"Last night, I had a dream that I swear I‚Äôve seen before but quickly forgot. Basically, my boyfriend (who I‚Äôve never seen in real life) and I were wandering the streets at night, talking about this case from the 1800s‚Äîsomething about an orphanage where the people were abusive toward the kids.

Somehow, we found ourselves in front of the building where it all happened. There was this huge concrete door. My boyfriend pushed on it, and it opened into some sort of portal leading to a red carpet. He said, ‚ÄúThis is the place. Come on, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

As soon as we stepped inside, we heard people talking and realized we were in the 1800s. My boyfriend told me that the kids were sleeping downstairs and that we had to save them. For some reason, he made me go downstairs to put water and, weirdly enough, actual shit into a crockpot. But before I could finish, one of the workers walked in, and I had to hide under a bed.

The room had about eight beds, only one of which was empty. There were two adults in the room, and they all stared at me as I tried to fill up the crockpot. When I finally left, my boyfriend directed me out while he distracted the adults.

At this point, I saw everything through his eyes because I had already escaped. I watched as he threw something at the adults and ran out of the building through a different exit, opposite the way we came in. He met me back at our original entry point.

After that, the dream shifted. Suddenly, we were inside a convenience store in a mall with another person we knew. For some reason, we were trying to escape from someone, and we attempted to jump into a movie channel‚Äîkind of like how it worked in Teen Titans (if you‚Äôve seen the series, you‚Äôd understand). And then I woke up.

I‚Äôm don‚Äôt sure what this dream means and why I feel i‚Äôve seen it before. I woke up feeling super weird about it though. Anyone else have this happen? or maybe a similar dream?

1jn8omj,Dream Highlights,"Days ago, I dreamt of kittens. I was in a public bathroom with my mom and sister, and ran into seth macfarlane. The guy with him asked if I was attractive. He said, *'She's alright.'* I was preoccupied with the cats, trying to keep the kittens together. There was a tabby kitten, gray kitten, black kitten, and maine coon. Who was possibly the tabby kitten. The black kitten was talkative, and had a bond with me. The gray one was my favorite.

A few days ago I dreamt that there was a intruder.

I had a dream I was looking at billboards and signs with my mom. Outside, before I was in my living room suddenly. I looked at signs, wanting to get photos of them. A few treehouse of horror themed signs from burger king was there. One was modern. They hung from the chandelier. There was other signs. Including other simpsons stuff. I looked through it all, distracted as my dad came up to the front door. He was wearing a submarine/diving suit. With a metal helmet. Green moss on it. When he took the helmet/costume off and looked normal, he smiled at me. I took photos of him as he did so. Apparently he was friends with one of the friends of my sister's husband, who died of drugs as well. It was vivid. Like a real exchange. There was keylime hostess cupcakes that I wanted photos of, along with a few other lime foods. Lindt truffles that were lime flavored. My mom was being a bitch. *'I always felt like a old person trapped in a young body..'* I said. Just then one of my little brother's walked downstairs and shot me, pressing a white gun onto the top of my head. I laid there, while my dad was holding me. My brother left the room with my mom, and other little brother; my family leaving the room. I called out for them. *'I never thought it would end like this..'* I said, turning around to see my dad's yellow skin. The hue was yellow, slightly. Arms around me. It almost seemed like my partner. I woke up after this.

A few days ago I dreamt I was in the living room, watching ouat. I saw food in the room. I vaguely recall seeing blueberry lindt truffles. I think it was raining outside. It was a spring day. The neverland episodes of once upon a time were on. Use me by love and rockets was playing. Later, I was with my family in a room. I was wearing heels. They were thin, and one broke off. A group of people with different ethnicities were in the room. They were apparently related to me. Speaking in a foreign language. There were arabs. My dad was nearby. Flagpole Sitta by harvey danger was playing. I woke up after this.

I had a dream I was at a school, then transitioned into a mall. In a classroom, I looked through a cabinet that had lilac milk inside it, pastel colored. There was another milk inside it. Other drinks.

I thought about what clothes I want to wear for the summer, picturing outfits. Wanting clothes for spring as well. I woke up in my bed in a dream. I vaguely remember seeing my partner's face at one point.

I woke up. Humans/oblivion by meat beat manifesto was playing, through my head.

Yesterday, I had a few dreams. In the first, I was being hit on by my sister's boyfriend. Then billy corgan talking to me. In the next dream, I was in my bedroom. I had a couple dreams about a nightmarish version of my bedroom. I found a cassette on the floor of the thompson twins. Shoegaze/noise style album. I then was in a liminal school, sitting down at a table with a nerdy guy. I felt comfortable with him. I was trying to take pictures of a jello pistachio pudding pie, and a rose pistachio cake/pie. A guy was staring at me. Hitting on me. I had a dream I was laying on a bed. My dad was nearby.  In another dream, I was in a slip dress. While in a room. I had a white slip dress on, as my nipples were hardening through the fabric. I unhooked my bra, tossing it. I felt the presence of a tall figure there, wondering if my partner was nearby. I also had the other dream of my bedroom, finding doors. One was at the top of the stairs. The others were against the wall. A couple of doors there. Across the staircase was a makeshift bridge, where a black cat was. Infront of me, beside another cat. I think there was a brown cat. In a weird dream, my mom bought me a baby blue tommy top. Saying that, *'You don't even like tommy.'* And showing me baby clothes with the lyrics to stay by lisa loeb on them. They were overalls.  I had another dream that I woke up in my bedroom, orbital playing. I dreamt of rugrats, also.

I was at a library, sitting at a table. I have this reoccurring library in my dreams. I'm looking for vhs tapes and books there, with my mom. I was looking for big comfy couch vhs tapes, skimming through the titles. Collecting vhs tapes that I wanted. While sitting at the table, I flipped through a book. Grabbing food out from in the book, candy. A caramel egg, that was soy free surprisingly. I thought about if there was caffeine in it.

Today, I could not sleep. Neptune in aries is conjuncting my mercury in aries right now. Neptune in pisces left, since it's transit from 2011/2012. Neptune is still sitting on my 12th house, though.

I had a dream that I was with my partner, in a room. Laying on a bed. This was all I dreamt about. We kissed, as I laid ontop of him. He kissed my breasts, nipples. Licking them. Sucking on them afterwards. *'Lick my clit..'* I said, moaning after he moved downwards and got inbetween my legs. Lowering his body under me. He licked my clit pretty well, holding me ontop of him. I moaned, thrusting my hips. I barely remember any of it. Vague snippets of us making eyecontact flashed through my mind, when I awoke. I might've grabbed his face. His curly hair got my attention. I had gas, which made me stop my movements. *'Sorry..'* I apologized, feeling the sensation. Leaning over in a crouched position. He said something to me. Asking how I didn't know/realize it. I woke up after.",3,0
1jnbmj8,My nightmares gave me hallucinations,"I had a discussion recently and it made me realise this. 
About 4-5 years ago, whenever I would have a nightmare I would have hallucinations of whatever scary character was in my nightmare. It would stand outside the screen door to the backyard every morning when I woke up and just look at me. This went on pretty frequently, not every night, about once every three nights, for ~1 year. It got to the point where I would dread getting out of bed. I didn't tell anybody because movies taught me that they'd call me crazy.
Did this mean anything? Was this a health issue? I would really like to know what the cause was.",2,1
1jn9mqx,Childhood dream that continued nightly for years then abruptly stopped,"As a child, I remember every single night without fail for a few years, I‚Äôd have the same (lucid?) recurring dream. I know it was every single night, especially because the night I didn‚Äôt have it is a landmark day in my memory and was the night I never had it again. I still remember how disappointed I was. I‚Äôm unsure if it counts as lucid because while I couldn‚Äôt control what was in the dream, I could do whatever I wanted in the dream, it felt like real life, and I was fully aware that this was a thing I‚Äôd dream every night (and I‚Äôd look forward to it!)

It was a house that never changed. I wasn‚Äôt ever inside the house. I‚Äôd always be outside on the lawn and in the garden. The garden was split into four, with each section being a different season! I had winter with snow, spring with flowers, summer with sunshine and fall with fallen leaves. There would be a big table in the garden full of yummy food that I could eat, but normal food and fruits, not like the lavish kind. There was a porch that overlooked the sections of the garden. 

The garden and the house were both small ‚Äî they weren‚Äôt big at all. The house wasn‚Äôt surrounded by anything but black void. It was a really, really comforting dream. No one else was ever there. No matter what happened in the day I‚Äôd look forward to having it at night. I‚Äôd fall asleep expecting it and when I‚Äôd start the dream, I‚Äôd have an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù feeling, like going to sleep was me making my way to the dream.

I remember my favorite part of the garden was winter because I‚Äôve never seen snow in real life.

And then, one day, I didn‚Äôt have it for the first time after years of having the dream, and I was really worried and scared I wouldn‚Äôt have it again. I never had it again. I really loved that house. I wonder what all that was about.",3,3
1jng4co,Weird twin cat visitors,"So I dreamt about two identical black cats with white ears and blue eyes. They both came in our apartment from the balcony and were acting like they were at home. Then I noticed that they had a lot of fleas and moved them in the bathroom to take them to the vet's the next day (this was a dream conversation between me and my husband, the implication was that we were keeping them). We have an orange cat and he was freaking out the whole time about the twin cats. And the weirdest part of the dream was that the bathroom was filled with fleas when we opened the door.

After some adventures, we ended up in this compound with a lot of other people. There was nurse or doctor who looked to be about seven months pregnant and she wanted to get me into this small room and examine me to see if I was also pregnant. It seemed like the goal was to have as many babies as possible.

Out in the hall, there was a man about to go onstage and speak to a large audience. He was wearing khakis and a yellow button up shirt and the shirt was embroidered with a logo that said ‚ÄúYellow Pill‚Äù. Then the dream ended.",1,0

1jn6khw,I was killed in my dream.. and i felt it,"last night i had a pretty vivid dream that i can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about. 

to set the scene: 

i was in a public location with someone and the room was on the smaller side. i don‚Äôt know if it was a pizza shop or a laundry room because it looked exactly like a small public laundry room but my brain understood that we were just in there waiting for our pizza so i don‚Äôt really know what was going on there lol. the person i was with was either my best friend or my sister. they didn‚Äôt look like either one of them, but again, my brain knew that they were close to me and we were either friends or sisters. we were sitting in brown folding chairs- yk the kind that are metal with a squishy plastic/fabric-like seat? the room was a light grey and it must have been early summer because it was sunny out and the weather was beautiful but it wasn‚Äôt extremely hot or blinding. the glass door was propped open and everything genuinely felt nice. there were a handful of other people/strangers in the room but every one was just having innocent casual conversation enjoying the day. this laundry room/pizza shop waiting room (i know i sound crazy stay with me) was part of an outdoor plaza so there were other small shops in the one area. all of a sudden we hear a man yell out ‚Äúeverybody get down on the ground!‚Äù as he‚Äôs commanding everyone to lay on their stomachs. this is all happening outside so i don‚Äôt see anything or anyone yet. i remember i just started saying ‚Äúoh my god oh my god ok oh my god‚Äù as i grab my jacket and place it over a different chair and attempt to quickly lay it out on the arm of this full on doctors office looking pleather/plastic fabric chair?? which, i don‚Äôt know why i was doing that or why it was so important, but weirdly enough this jacket was the exact same jean jacket i‚Äôve been wearing throughout the past month anytime i leave the house. anyway, after this guy tells everyone outside and in this plaza to get down there‚Äôs gun shots going off. the gun was an automatic firearm so the shots were just coming one right after another. i was terrified and i had just gotten to the floor laying with my arms bent next to my head and the guy comes running in the room. he‚Äôs wearing sunglasses and i think read noise canceling headphones and i remembered trying to brace myself for the pain and thinking about what it was going to feel like to die as we all are laying on this grey tiled floor. none of us ran or even thought to and we immediately complied. the first people he turns to are me and my friend/sister and instead of shooting twice (directly at her and then me) he‚Äôs just shooting in our direction multiple times. he shoots towards her and im holding my eyes tightly closed knowing im going to die, and then i do. the shot that killed me was to my back, im assuming hitting my heart, but i died immediately. not even a second of struggle or pain. just simply dead.

the thing about this dream that has kept it on my mind all day is that i so clearly felt myself die‚Äî but not in my back. when i died from being shot in my back i felt it in my head, in my brain. it was like a warm rush of what i can only describe as a liquid flowing over my brain?? there was no pain and instantly it was over. almost like a peaceful feeling but i had fully died. i was dead. in my dream i thought, ‚Äúwow i can‚Äôt believe that just happened to me. my life is now over and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù but not in a sad way, more of a matter of fact calming way. i briefly thought about my parents for maybe .0002 seconds but again, not in a sad way.

though parts of the dream were confusing, vague, or fuzzy (like the type of location and whether i was with my sister or friend), it was so incredibly real. and im just so confused as to why i felt it happen in my head and why it wasn‚Äôt a painful feeling or why it wasn‚Äôt sad or dull in color. even though the room was grey, everything was vibrant. i braced myself for impact, for the pain but it was more like when you unplug a tv, it was so fast and tbh it was even more soft than unplugging a tv. idk if i explained any of this well enough so that people can understand what im explaining or if it even made sense. 

but here are my questions: 

does this dream mean anything? 
is there a reason I dreamt this? 
why did i feel it, especially like that and in that location? 
and why is this dream so stuck on my mind? 

if anyone has any thoughts, answers, or interpretations, please let me know because i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.",6,10
1jnfx6u,Dreamed about an anime surrounding a teen mom.,"I had the strangest dream last night/this morning, and I need to get it out before I forget. I dreamed I was watching an anime about a teen mom who was trying to hide the fact that she was a teen mom, like one of those gag animes. I watched the entire first episode in my dream, and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what triggered it. The last thing I watched before bed was The Apothecary Diaries (you know, with the handsome, flirtatious guy and Maomao üòÇ).

In the dream, I was sitting in the living room watching the show, and it was showing the backstory of this teen couple. The boy‚Äôs mom didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúruin‚Äù his future, so they moved away, and the pregnant girl ended up being homeschooled. After she had the baby, she started high school when the baby was about a year old. Her main goal was just to live a somewhat normal life, but of course, it‚Äôs full of misunderstandings. So, she goes to class, introduces herself, starts making some new friends, and when she pulls out her notebooks, a pacifier falls out of her bag. She quickly tries to grab it, but the other students are super confused. Their thoughts immediately are insane, but no one thinks ‚ÄúOh, she has a kid.‚Äù You know how they show those inner thoughts? One girl thought, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs got a dude with a diaper fetish and he dresses up like a baby.‚Äù Then it shows this big hairy guy in a diaper, sucking on the pacifier and raising his hands like he wants to be picked up. Like, WTF? Don‚Äôt judge me, lol, I have no idea why I dreamed this.

So, to cover up the situation, the teen mom makes up this ridiculous story about soaking the pacifier in something for a toothache and saying it helps if you suck on it. Of course, it just made her look way weirder than if she had just admitted she had a kid.

Like he's always got a hidden agenda during these dreams and more often then not it's up to me to stop him in these dreams. Anyone know why this happens?
On another note, I have a dream journal and have had for about a year at this point.

1jnb5wa,"A dream that was simultaneously a Broadway musical, a concept album, and an Afghan quilt","The quilt was knitted from brightly colored yarn and had geometric patterns of circles inside of squares.

The album had a picture of the quilt as an album cover. The hit single on the album was called ""One, Two, Data!"" and the lyrics were just that phrase over and over.

Each of the characters in the play wore a costume that was decorated with yarn from the quilt that had been unraveled.

The main character in the quilt was the only one whose costume had more than one color of yarn.  He was portrayed as a crazy conspiracy theorist because he saw connections between all the other characters in the play which the other characters insisted weren't there. Whenever he would try to explain what he saw, everyone would break out in song, singing ""One, Two, Data! One, Two, Data!""

1jnfifw,"Full Eclipse, Tornado, Sister Turning Into Snake?","I had a surgery last week and have been having such vivid, interesting dreams as I‚Äôve been recovering. Last night I dreamt that I was outside my house looking at another person from across the street (I can‚Äôt remember who it was atm). We were waiting for a full eclipse of the sun to happen and we were smiling at each other in anticipation. When it happened it went from completely light to 100% dark. I felt my excitement shift suddenly to fear. Then, all of a sudden, I‚Äôm in the car with my mom and she‚Äôs driving. It‚Äôs light again but I notice in the rear view window storm clouds are forming, and I watch as a funnel cloud forms into a tornado. It happens extremely fast, and it comes straight toward us. I remember my mom is trying to gun it, but I know we aren‚Äôt going to make it and the tornado sucks us up. Then next thing I remember I‚Äôm at a sort of gathering with friends and family. My sister seems upset and is crying but she is elusive and says she‚Äôll tell me what‚Äôs going on when we get home. Eventually she tells me that a friend of ours keeps talking about how she believes she is going to turn into a werewolf and my sister is scared by this possibility. In the dream my mom also hears this and she and I both are concerned, because we both think this concept is completely unrealistic and we‚Äôre worried for my friend‚Äôs mental health. Next thing I know I‚Äôm in the room alone and I hear my mom let out a sort of laugh, like a laugh of disbelief, and it freaks me out. I say ‚ÄúWhat? What happened?‚Äù and follow her force, feeling fear and a sense of dread. I am worried that my sister has done something to hurt herself. My mom is quiet and pointing to something in the room. I‚Äôm incredibly scared to look but when I do I see a yellow snake slithering on the ceiling/wall. And I realize my sister has turned into a snake. I am relieved she hasn‚Äôt hurt herself but also freaked out she is suddenly a snake, and I feel intense feelings of sadness. My mom seems to accept it and lets the snake coil around her arm playfully. The snake slithers around the ground and I find myself wondering if my sister is still ‚Äúin there‚Äù or if she‚Äôs literally just a snake now. I reach out to touch it gently but startle it and it bites me. I start to cry and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù The snake pulls its teeth out of my arm and is somehow able to heal the wound. It is then I realize she can understand me.

1jnf1s1,I dream about a girl who had a crush on a teacher,"A girl had a crush on her teacher, who was very kind and reserved. He was the teacher for their last class, and all the students liked him because he was easy to get along with. There was one girl in the classroom who liked the teacher, but nobody ever noticed, as she was very good at hiding her feelings. One day, the teacher decided to throw a party for the class, where everyone brought their own food. My friend and I made rice and eggs; she made a big egg for herself and three little ones for me. As we were all eating, I wanted to check the time, but my phone was off. Suddenly, it turned on by itself, and I saw that it was 3:02. The bell rang at 3:03. When I looked around, it was just my friends and the teacher who were left. My friend and I were trying hard to finish eating our food before the bell rang. When the bell rang, my friends ran home without even eating the eggs, so I stayed behind to put as much food in my mouth as I could before I left. The big egg was too much, so I only ate half of it and then ran outside. As I ran out, I saw some kids getting into the teacher's car. When the teacher came to get into his car, he made the two students get out to go home. He then returned to close the classroom door. The girl who liked him followed him inside and confessed her feelings to the teacher. He was shocked and said he couldn't do anything about it. The girl became angry and said something else to him before leaving. The teacher seemed reluctant to follow her. One of the girl's uncles happened to be passing by and asked why she was upset. As the teacher's car drove away, the girl explained her situation to her uncle. When she realized that the teacher might be following her because of what she had said, she started running to reach his car. The uncle warned her, saying, ""This is not the right thing to do; you will put the teacher in a bad situation."" He ran to try to stop her but couldn't catch up. The girl called out the teacher's name, and when he saw her, he stopped the car, allowing her to get into the car together.

1jnehn2,Had a wild dream last night,"

I was on a trip to Disney World  with my class, and for some reason, we were all sharing one room. While we were there, I went to a candy store inside Disney. At some point, one of the girls in the class turned out to be Lindsey, a girl I‚Äôve had a crush on for a long time. I ended up telling her how I felt‚Äîand then she suddenly turned into my dad.

Later on in the dream, near the end of the trip, we went to Walmart. I was trying to pick out a Nintendo Switch game, and there was a Walmart dog wearing a vest nearby. A guy was helping me out, but he didn‚Äôt end up getting a game. Instead, he randomly brought me a bunch of sour Icebreakers. I thanked him, but then realized I didn‚Äôt need that many, so I put most of them back and kept just three.

Then the employees told me I had to pay for all the Icebreakers the guy had brought me, and I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing that.‚Äù As I walked out of the store, the guy started calling the police. Then, out of nowhere, this total Karen came up to me and started giving me a hard time, saying, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a dad.‚Äù

I called my dad, and he answered, telling me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to cancel reservations.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Karen got in a car inside Walmart and started driving off, and I stood in front of the car trying to stop her‚Äîhoping to prove that my dad was coming to save the day. Then the dream ended no closure if my dad came or not

Oh, and earlier in one of the classes, there was this event called a CMC thing doesn't matter what it stands for it was a private dinner only for kids who took 6 classes not 5, and I wasn‚Äôt invited because i was only taken 5 classes. It was a college class, but weirdly, there were also high school kids there some that I knew, even though I haven‚Äôt seen them at my current school.

That crush Lindsey shows back up in my dreams every now and then but has never turned into another person so I was confused when all of sudden I looked and it was my dad for idk how long before finally turning back

1jnecq5,Near death experience ?,"Last night I had the most trippiest experience ever, I smoked a bong like usual before I went to bed and I started to get real sleepy, maybe 10-15 minutes in I had this very weird ‚Äúdream‚Äù happen to me.

At first when I started to ‚Äúdream‚Äù I was looking at my bed laying down on my side with my eyes open, I started to fade away like everything before me started to fade, during me transitioning into whatever it was, all I could think of was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die now‚Äù and saying ‚Äúthis is it I didn‚Äôt know it would happen so soon‚Äù and the whole big thought that I could feel throughout my body was that I was dying in my sleep. 

After fading away from reality and getting that thought, I was like sucked up in the air but I couldn‚Äôt see where because it was all light, with stuff like words getting sucked up with me too, after getting sucked up I seen my own body and on the right side of it I could see all my memories playing out like a movie but all of it in like 10 seconds. I had a very bad feeling and knew that I was going to die. Then I had so many thoughts of regret on how I was so rude to my family and how I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything. Then it‚Äôs like I had the choice to go back or not, I heard it in my brain it was weird, I wanted to go back. Then it‚Äôs like I fell down back into my body and jumped back up.

And all of this had very scary real feelings going throughout my body. Like when I was getting sucked up it wasn‚Äôt no dream I felt it in my brain and my body what was going on. Dreams you can tell apart from if it felt real or not but this was so real, I would tell you guys in more detail but it was so complex that it was out of my understanding and explanation. ",1,0
1jmtx04,"I have beaten up my evil sleep paralysis demons, now I find my my hallucinations comforting","For the past few years, I have been experiencing sleep paralysis periodically, occurring 1 to 5 times per week.

My ears were always ringing, my body ached, and I would always hallucinate something or someone. Sometimes, the entities were recurring; other times, they were different.
Some examples: a person standing in the corner, elongating their neck until their head was right in front of me; an eight-legged, completely black ‚Äúhuman‚Äù crawling along the walls or ceiling into my bed, squeezing my limbs and causing unbearable pain; masked people in robes standing around my bed, resembling a cult; or something clinging to my shoulders, pressing its fingers into my armpits, which was also really painful.

Rarely was I actually anxious since I was aware it was all in my head. I always tried to move as much as I could to wake up‚Äîonly to fall asleep again and experience the same thing all over. Occasionally, I had a lucid dream afterward.

My idea was that since it was all in my head, I should decide who was allowed in. So I learned lucid dreaming‚Äînot to the extent of controlling my dreams every night, but just enough to take control after sleep paralysis. There I was, lying in bed, unable to move, staring the monster in the eyes with full intention to fuck it up. I entered a lucid dream, stood up, and beat them up. After a while, they started running away, jumping through the window onto the street. So I followed them, making sure they wouldn‚Äôt come back. I became my nightmare‚Äôs nightmare, lol.

Nowadays, my sleep paralysis isn‚Äôt scary anymore‚Äîmy body doesn‚Äôt hurt, and my ears don‚Äôt really ring. My hallucinations now consist of either a cute animals or an attractive woman who comforts me and with whom I can have conversations about things I can‚Äôt discuss with others.

Then we discovered this homeless man that would constantly walk around the house so we locked the doors. I saw him in the garage too, assuming this is a day or ao later i get a message from a friend from school :EMERGENCY, there was an accident involving someone earlier, lock your doors and stay out of sight, even starving is better then the fate you will find if you don‚Äôt protect yourself: id yelled at everyone to stay in my room but later that same friend came telling us he found a way to escape,so id went out to the porch to see a dark almost greenish hew of the sky, i was following him with a horrible sense of dread over me. but the truck the friend had had only had space for 4 people and i wouldn‚Äôt have saved everyone. I chose the people over saving myself. (Didnt think about throwing a few in the trunk for some reason) i was about to run inside when i felt a dark presence near me and i saw a giant black humanoid flesh creature, with skinny legs and skinny arms, and a messed up face. I knew it was the poor homeless man, i didnt see proof but i knew it was him immediately. It was like a vision of what had happened while i was talking to  the friend so when  i did enter i had seen the ground torn apart and lights broken, something had been in there by then. I check my room and see holding a mangled body and it trying to kill one more of the people hiding in my house, but then it just died. Im not sure what happened after that all i remember is a clear blue sky. The face of the monster is stuck in my head ",1,0

I was pulled over and I pulled out my license. He told me I was speeding and to just say I would not sign the ticket which sounded odd to me. I thought I was going to get a ticket or a warning. I asked repeatedly for a supervisor and he kept denying my request. I asked for my speed he didn't know. That's when I saw his badge and saw he was a rent a cop. I then asked him what my license plate number was and he said he didn't know. So I proceeded to take off.

1jnd42a,Hadn‚Äôt Dreamed in Years‚ÄîThen Everything Changed,"I was doing edibles or smoking the real thing (one day this, one day that..) for a couple of years and during that time I never dreamed.

I have 3 months free of doing edibles and smoking and‚Ä¶ I dream every day! It‚Äôs crazy! I also feel my mind more stable and I feel more control over my emotions. But this post is how amazed I am that every night I have vivid dreams with powerful emotions‚Ä¶ I didnt have that for yearssssss when I smoked or did edibles‚Ä¶ I wonder scientifically‚Ä¶ why that is?



Edit:: I asked ChatGPT and this is what it returned.

Why do dreams come back after quitting weed?

Cannabis (whether smoked or eaten) affects your REM sleep, the stage of sleep where most vivid dreams happen. When you use weed regularly, it tends to suppress REM sleep, which leads to fewer dreams or no memory of dreaming at all. So when someone stops, the brain rebounds‚Äîthis is called REM rebound‚Äîand suddenly, dreams come back stronger, more vivid, and sometimes even intense.

What does that imply?
	1.	Your brain is rebalancing: It means your sleep cycles are returning to their natural rhythm.
	2.	Memory and emotional processing might improve: REM sleep is deeply linked to memory consolidation and emotional healing. When you dream again, your brain is working through things more naturally.
	3.	Your endocannabinoid system is resetting: Weed interacts with this system, which regulates mood, sleep, appetite, and more. Removing weed gives this system time to recalibrate.

What part of the brain is responsible for dreaming?

Dreaming, especially during REM sleep, is a complex process involving multiple areas:
	‚Ä¢	Pons: Located in the brainstem, it helps trigger REM sleep and sends signals to the rest of the brain.
	‚Ä¢	Thalamus: Acts like a relay station, sending sensory information to the cortex (but it‚Äôs mostly turned off during deep sleep‚Äîmore active in REM).
	‚Ä¢	Amygdala: Processes emotions, which is why dreams often feel emotionally charged.
	‚Ä¢	Hippocampus: Deals with memory, so it helps pull pieces of your experiences into your dreams.
	‚Ä¢	Prefrontal Cortex: This part, which handles logic and decision-making, is less active during dreams, which is why dreams can feel so illogical or surreal.

So dreaming again is a powerful sign that your brain is healing, rebalancing, and returning to its natural rhythm. It can even be symbolic of waking up to more of yourself.",1,0

1jncj4p,Really weird dream I had last night what does it mean?,"Last night I woke up at 6 bc I forgot to unset my alarm, and when I went back to bed I had the weirdest dream ever.

So it started that I was at an audition for my school's next play, it was a fashion show (this part makes sense bc closing night for my school's musical which I'm in is tonight). But then when I went to leave, I couldn't find the exit. I kept feeling like I was rushed and didn't have enough time/wasn't moving fast enough.

I managed to eventually find my way out, and it turns out that was a dream inside a dream. There was a weird jump and then I was in I think a farm? It had large green fields on either side of a long, winding path that splintered off into different parts like a maze. I went into this farmhouse and met 2 or 3 girls. I explored the house with them before realizing I couldn't find the exit. I went to them for help and they helped me to the exit. I took a picture of them on my iPad because they helped me and I wanted to remember them, but I remember my iPad being really weird. Any time i went into the photos app, the environment around me would change. (If anyone has seen that one guy playing ai Minecraft, it felt like that). I then tried to find my way out of the farm itself, but got really lost. I ran back to the farmhouse, but it was different somehow. I was crying at this point, and they once again helped me to the exit. I woke up still in my dream and went to my dance studio, where I talked to my oldest sister and told her about it. I mentioned the thing with my iPad and she agreed that she'd been having the same dreams, and mentions that they've been happening since our parents got a new basement door. We were then in a dream inside a dream together in my school. We were confronted by the people in my school's musical, the lead stood out in particular. I started questioning him while hitting him with a metal waterbottle that didn't do anything, and he revealed that he was actually just an evil doppelg√§nger of our lead, and then they started chasing us and we still could find the exit, and then I woke up.

1jn5wu9,The murder house in the dead woods,"So I had a dream where I was lost in some forest in what seemed to be either the beginning or the end of winter. All the trees seemed dead without their leaves and there was a bit of snow on the ground.

Fortunately (I thought) I found a little house. The family who lived there welcomed me warmly and imvited me to stay with them for a while. There was the father, who did most of the talking, the mother, and the two kids who didn't seem to do much. In fact I started to think something was weird. After dinner I was just hanging around when I (foolishly) opened a little hatch door in the kitchen floor. There was some sort of cellar, but it was full of dead people. Like a literal pile of corpses, the one on top of the pile still had a bloody knife in the back. 

The mother remained perfectly calmed and said something like ""there's 140 corpses in there, yep"". And the father immediately decided he was going to kill me for this. He chased me around the house, I escaped by jumping from a window on the 2nd floor and ran into the forest.

Running away was difficult because I realized I was running on dead deer. Hundreds of dead deer, which I somehow understood to be victims of the angry father (he had no name btw). I understood he simply liked to kill for the sake of it. 

I somehow ran foe a while but only made it back to the house where I was captured by the mother. That's when a police car arrived. 2 cops came out. I was so happy to be saved that I flipped off the entire family (the father was still outside) and told them to f themselves. 

Unfortunately the father sneaked behind a cop, stabbed him in the neck, stole his gun and shot the 2 cops dead. Then I think he killed me and I woke up. 

My description is maybe not perfect but the dream was so vivid it scared the crap out of me. ",4,2
1jn5u6z,"A dream I call ""The Hound""","They there! dream story time. So that's a rendition I never actually finished of how I looked like in this particular dream. It was set in a world or place where medieval/feudal aspecta mixed with futuristic ones, specially science wise.

There, a sketchy lord had captured both my best friend and I, wanting to keep her as his wife agaisnt her wishes. The fate he decided for me was to be the one to help him keep her captive, by modifying me biologically.

You see, that lord in the dream, ran a business by controlling people's minds and will via chemicals or implants and in my case, he inyected me something daily that made me forget who I was, forget about my friend, and kind of be in factory settings convinced that I had always been with him as part of his bodyguard and his ""hound"" with enhanced physical skills and ability to track people down, more specifically my friend. I had an unbearable instict to find her whenever she tried to escape, that was my job and I was 100% it had always been that way. 

Under his command, I kept my friend from escaping his manor multiple tiems and she of course begged me to remember her  and help her. At some point idk how I managed to override that Jekyll & hyde situation within myself and came back to my senses. I apologized profusely for everything I had done while I was not myself and helped her get away together. 

We were chased by the lord's guards and where they seemed too close for both of us to make it, i told her to keep going while I bought time. I waited and tried to fight them off but I was thwon to the ground and held there. When I was pinned down, some people in white lab coats stabbled a needle on my neck. It hurt like hell and I knew I was being ""transformed"" again into the hound. I was just hoping that my friend had gotten away and was passing out until I woke up in real life.",4,1
1jn4mls,The Hanged Man showed up again,"So, a few days ago, I made a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1jjj873/was_told_in_a_fever_dream_to_sleep_in_a_certain/)about a dream I had last year in which I was told by a dream character to sleep in a certain position to ""access Yggdrasil."" Several commentators chimed in saying that the imagery was somewhat reminiscent of that of the The Hanged Man in tarot, and others recommended that I try meditating in that posture. Since then, I've done so a few times, usually just for five minutes or so.

Well, this morning, I was in church and, as has been my habit during Lent, was doing Lectio Divina while waiting for the service to start in the pews. Lectio Divina basically means that you read a piece of scripture, reread it while reflecting on what it says to you, pray about the topic of your reflection, and then spend 10 minutes or so ""resting in God"" and just chilling. Well, during that last part, I usually start to fall asleep lol. The same thing happened today and I started to nod off and have one of those half-asleep dreams. It was very short: I could see a thick, heavy book with the pages being rapidly flipped through by an unseen hand. On the pages were rows of Hebrew letters. I grew up Jewish, so it reminded me of the Siddur. It was being flipped through so rapidly that most of the letters were just a blur, but one letter stood out to me and remained with me when I woke up. It was the Hebrew letter *mem* (with a dagesh mark inside).

Now, I haven't studied a lick of Hebrew since I was an elementary schooler, so I had to do some Googling to even find out that the letter was mem. This brought me to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mem), which to my surprise read:

>Mem is associated with [The Hanged Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hanged_Man_(tarot_card)) (Atu XII), the element of water and the path between Geburah and Hod on the Tree of Life.

Mem also stands for the number 40 in numerology, and given I'm in the middle of the 40 days of Lent, is also relevant in that way. Pretty cool!",5,6
1jnbszi,Stuck on Top of a Mountain,"I was exploring a dense forest, when I suddenly found myself on top of a very high mountain.

The sky was clear, and the mountain itself was covered in a thick layer of green moss, which was damp and extremely slippery.

I carefully walked around the summit to find a safe path to climb down the mount, but to no avail. My foot suddenly slipping as I was looking over a cliff was enough to make me lay face down on the ground.

In this prone position, I took out my phone and tried sharing my location to my family, hoping for a rescue party, but there was no signal. My phone's battery was almost dead, and I didn't want to risk dropping it down the mountain, so I carefully placed it back into my pocket.

Uh oh.

Was I really stuck on top of this mountain? Was that it? I could feel the anxiety increasing in me, my stomach clenching. This feeling was quickly turning into a kind of panic in the face of helplessness.

I eventually woke up, which allowed me to escape this predicament.",1,0
1jnboir,I had this lucid dream of getting groped,"

Last night, I had one of the strangest and most intense dreams of my life, and I can't shake the feeling that it meant something deeper.

In my dream, I was not just myself‚ÄîI was an assassin or a spy, part of a covert team assigned to investigate a hidden underground lab. The place was dark, eerie, and filled with secrets. As we moved through the shadows, someone‚Äîhis face obscured‚Äîgot close to me. Too close. He started touching me, groping me. And the strangest part? I didn‚Äôt stop him. I let it happen.

In the dream, I knew I was already in a relationship with someone else. The guilt gnawed at me, but at the same time, there was this undeniable thrill. It felt like cheating, yet it also felt... inevitable. Like something I was meant to experience.

Then, the scene shifted. Suddenly, I was at an outdoor church picnic‚Äîexcept none of the people there were actually churchgoers. It was more like a lakeside camp, a resort with wooden cottages and soft, golden sunlight filtering through the trees. The air was thick with the sound of laughter, conversations, and hidden desires. And then he was there again. The faceless man.

He touched me again, and I didn‚Äôt resist. I let it happen, let myself drown in it, and we did it somewhere secluded while others were doing the same in secret little corners. It was exhilarating, forbidden, and so intense that I could still feel it even after I woke up‚Äîlike a phantom touch lingering on my skin.

I woke up sweating, heart racing, feeling strangely... incomplete. Like I had lost something. Like I had just glimpsed a past life or a parallel existence that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to remember.

Was this just a wild dream, or could it be something more? Has anyone else ever felt this kind of eerie connection to a dream?

1jn3bog,Why do I always dream about cheating on my bf?,"We are in a long distance relationship and I would say our relationship is very healthy. I am also very satisfied with this relationship (except for the part that I don‚Äôt get to see him often). 

However, it has been a reoccurring issue that I always dream about cheating whether sexually or emotionally. Specifically it has a similar pattern‚Äîin the dreams, I would have some opportunities to cheat (it would either be I‚Äôm wanting to break up with my bf in that dream which makes me see other guys, or some guy is into me and I reciprocate), then after the cheating occurs (again, physically or emotionally) I would feel guilt in the dream and want to confess my wrong doings to my boyfriend and the guy I cheated with (if needed). So in almost every of these dreams I‚Äôm fully aware that I‚Äôm cheating and then also feel guilt afterwards. Also in almost every of these dreams the guilt comes from remembering how much my bf means to me then wanting to stop the cheating deed because of that.

I know dreams could be random and mean nothing, but since I‚Äôm seeing a very clear pattern here, I wonder why. 

Also ill mention that I have been having these dreams for as long while now, not something that started recently. It‚Äôs also very frequent, around 1 out of 4 dreams it‚Äôs about this. I dream multiple dreams every night.",6,11

anyways me and my partner comes out from a convenience store when i accidentally locked eyes with this guy, drunk and wasted. 

i was gonna walk pass by him but then he pointed the gun at me and shoots me.

i remember falling on the ground i tried to crawl my way out. i look up at him,begging him to spare me, he pointed it again but this time in my head then he fired one last time.

i felt the pain, it was weird as fuck.

i woke up, started avoiding going outsides late at night cause i thought it was some kind of premonition shit.

days past i forgot about that dream, then one time i was out with my partner late at night, and guess what? yeah, we're in a fucking convenience store.
as i come out from the door,i started to have dejavu, weird shit feelings, you know like how everything can be so same and familiar but not really?

i've got bunch of weird ass dreams.

1jn7xv1,"Reoccurring dream for years, I have no other dreams. Haven‚Äôt dreamt in years but finally did last night. It was that one.","Sorry for the long post. I‚Äôm not sure what to tag this as either, I know it‚Äôs a reoccurring dream but I am asking for help. 

I‚Äôve been having the same dream(s) for years. Literally, I don‚Äôt have dreams if it‚Äôs not these ones. I can‚Äôt describe everything because of how long it‚Äôs been and how often I‚Äôve have them. I don‚Äôt actually sleep and I know it. I still think. I‚Äôm still conscious. I haven‚Äôt dreamt in years and I read that facing your head north is bad (I‚Äôd been doing it for the duration of no dreams) so I faced south last nigh to see and I had a dream. It was the reoccurring dream and I straight up thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the bathroom‚Ä¶ why am I here? I‚Äôm dreaming, I‚Äôm getting better.‚Äù And then I woke up. 

It‚Äôs always in a school, or in a bathroom that‚Äôs part of said school. They look like the ‚Äúbackrooms.‚Äù The bathroom is huge and everything is metal except the toilets. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ rows of stalls with doors that have huge gaps. Always.

I always, at least once in every dream, go to this one overwhelmingly bright classroom, with a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù (?) I can‚Äôt see the face of. I don‚Äôt know what I do or why I go.

I always leave through the front. Sometimes the dream starts outside, and there‚Äôs usually a van out there. Sometimes I go in it and bother the ‚Äútwo men‚Äù that work there before I go inside the school. No faces.

Every time I leave I have this feeling of ‚Äúescaping.‚Äù But I always go in the school‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt feel bad going in. Sometimes when I leave, I‚Äôm blocked by this metal-bar thing like a cage and I have to climb and/or jump over. Sometimes I can‚Äôt get out. 

The thing is‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs one person with a face. And I ‚Äúknow‚Äù her. But‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs a stranger I went to high school with. I saw her frequently but only freaking talked to her a few times, and just things like ‚Äúhi‚Äù and she ‚Äúordered‚Äù cake pops from me that I never made and then never talked to her again. 

We escape together, we walk through the halls together. She‚Äôs always there. She always smiles. She‚Äôs always smiling‚Ä¶

Why am I having this dream? It‚Äôs been years. I‚Äôve been trying so hard to figure it out. I have no other dreams, and this was the first dream I had in years. The first dream I have in 1-2 years is the reoccurring dream in the jail-school with the girl I spoke to a handful of times always smiling at me, it‚Äôs freaking creepy and I‚Äôm tired. I have constant brain fog.

1jn2nwj,I missed both the flights. What does it mean? Been going through career stress in life,"Let me tell you the whole story. In my dream, I first reached the airport. My airline was SpiceJet, and I was being handed my boarding pass. I didn‚Äôt really notice at first, but the destination on it was Chennai‚Äîeven though I was supposed to fly to Hyderabad.

When boarding started, I suddenly realized the mistake. I also remembered that I had actually booked an IndiGo flight to Hyderabad, not SpiceJet. Panicked, I tried recalling my PNR number and all the details, but I couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere.

At that moment, I had two choices:
	1.	Rush to board the SpiceJet flight to Chennai‚Äîsince at least it was closer to Hyderabad.
	2.	Find my IndiGo flight details and get on the right plane.

I started running, trying to do both at once‚Äîlooking for my IndiGo boarding pass while also making sure I didn‚Äôt miss the SpiceJet flight. Finally, I found my PNR and rushed to the IndiGo counter, hoping I could still catch my flight.

When I got there, they checked my details and told me, ‚ÄúYour flight was on March 10. The date has already passed.‚Äù I felt stuck‚Äîthere was nothing they could do.

Desperate, I asked, ‚ÄúCan I at least catch the SpiceJet flight to Chennai?‚Äù The staff responded, ‚ÄúYou should rush, it‚Äôs about to take off.‚Äù I sprinted, hoping to make it in time.

1jn9aus,The Funeral Home Dream,"I have worked in the death care industry for about four years now, assisting with funerals, body removals/transports, cremations, embalming, and everything in between. Lately, I fear the constant exposure to tragedy, gore, and trauma in this job is manifesting into something deeper.
In my waking life, I feel fine‚ÄîI love my job, Handling the intense cases doesn‚Äôt scare me or give me anxiety whatsoever. I‚Äôd even say I feel unaffected (on the surface). I perform my duties professionally and handle everything well. However, I have a recurring nightmare...The dream is never usually exactly the same but always deals with similar situations. In the dream it always takes place during the final stages of a body removal. I am back at the funeral home, unloading the body and placing it in the cooler. It‚Äôs always this specific stage.
Usually, I am alone or with a co-worker, but the funeral home is always dark and unnerving. For some reason, sometimes we are in the basement, but mainly the cooler on the main level, surrounded by numerous bodies wrapped in sheets filling every shelf around me. Nothing overtly terrifying happens‚Äîthe dead bodies never move, and I‚Äôm not being chased‚Äîbut there is a looming presence, almost evil in nature. It fills me with anxiety and panic. Sometimes, I feel as if the bodies (or their spirits) are listening and watching my every move, staring at me through the sheets, as if they are still alive. But they are dead...maybe something in-between?
In the dream, I rush to complete my task as quickly as possible so that I can go home, the way one might sprint up the stairs after turning off a dark hallway light, fearing something unknown behind them. The figures follow me, watching me, rush up on me, but never touch me or speak. They are dead. I imagine that if they were standing in front of me, they would be motionless, blank-faced, yet radiating an uneasy aura.
Despite these recurring nightmares, my experience at work does not cause me any negative or anxious emotions while awake‚ÄîI genuinely enjoy my job. But I can‚Äôt help but wonder: is this truly a form of suppressed emotions from the nature of my job, or could it be something stranger.

Then I see my boyfriend, in many moments he was stresssing me and saying he was going to break up until he breaks up and told me horrifying things.

In one part I saw myself around weird people, I was afraid but not with courage to leave. Then I saw myself fighting with my boyfriend because he left all the chocolate I bought for him to melt other than put in the fridge and I simply got extremely angry in my dream, EXTREMELY, screaming, saying he was ungrateful, but the funniest part: I didn't see his face, I mostly felt his presence.

1jn7s2h,what does my dream mean??  please help my heart aches..,"TW SELF HARM/DEPRESSION

i had a dream last night where i was very frail and weak bodied and the sh on my arms were all incredibly bruised (it genuinely ached irl so i think that pain just crossed over) and i was really sick and basically near death almost in the dream - and i think its just an exaggeration of how i feel currently mentally. but in my weakness, this person who i REALLY liked a few years ago who recently started talking to me (from him which really made me happy) was there and he comforted me, and we spent time just sitting next to each other and talking for hours on end. i usually hate being pitied for my illness because i always sense it is an obligation from others when they express pity - but in this dream, this guy, he pitied me out of genuine concern and love, and stood by me and did everything to make sure i was alright and i felt so comforted. the dream felt so long and it was just him and i talking, bonding, laughing and it was almost indescribable how safe and loved i felt. 

now im going to talk about the ACTUAL person and real life, to give context to the dream and hopefully provide information that can help me decipher my dream. the thing is with this person, he is incredibly unique and i think his character is so beautiful. hes so smart and insightful and i truly think hes on a different wavelength to everyone else in such a drastically noticeable way. i admire him so so much. and recently he struck a conversation with me and we talked for hours and really clicked, he is the exact type of weird i understand and never find in anyone else. he also asked to be penpals, and of course i agreed. so my friends also think hes interested and its going good - but the thing is, i dont know if its his eccentricity or if he actually isnt interested or something, but hes leaving me on delivered right now after i replied to him saying hello to me?? despite that he is interacting with my posts on social media. so im sort of in a confused state, and as much as i really feel a connection to this person im in doubt whether he feels so to me. 

CRUCIAL detail i forgot to mention, we know each other in real life since a few years ago and were never too close (despite me admiring him greatly back then too) until recently, where ive moved to a different country for the year. ill return to my home country next year where weve promised to meet up sometime. 

but what im asking by making this post is, what was my dream telling me?? and beside that, am i being too wishful?? i really cant stop thinking about him.",1,1
1jn7joy,Funny dream I just had,"I just had a dream where I was at this all day long event on my college's campus & it was funded/sponsored by the college, but it actually had alcohol on tap & there were zero stipulations or legal annoyances going on. The funny thing though is their drinks weren't normal portions. My bloody Mary came in this giant glass bucket which had like 10 gallons lmao. I just drank it straight from the massive glass container, and everyone's drinks were of similar sizes. In addition to my massive bloody Mary, I had a lot of fried rice with veggies.

Also I *think* it was a bloody Mary. It was transparent & had a reddish orange color. Tasted like.. grapefruit, oranges, tomatoes, alcohol *(obviously)*, & had some other spice to it, maybe pepper & lime or lemon? It's alcohol tasted like one kinda spicy & bleh. Was definitely a hard liquor I don't normally enjoy. I'm not too experienced with drink mixing yet tbh lol.",1,0
1jn7jau,"I keep dreaming about my ex showing up in the future, what does it mean?","So how the dream goes is I am an outdoor guide(horses, camping, etc). So I am with clients on an excursion for this spring coming up. Having one of the best times, best clients, etc. Everything going good. Then I get a satelite text from the owners wife saying I have a visitor which is weird cause I am 5-6 hours of where I actually live so can't have any really, then I wonder why not get in touch with her husband. Just says I will have a visitor, and I know his wife she doesn't give too much detail cause she doesnt want to distract from your job at the time, handle that later. So the trip wraps up and I show up to their house and there is my ex, a complete mess, cries that nothing is going right and that she saw a therapist and says she has bpd, and I wake up. What does it mean? Cause I can see her doing that. I have had other dreams such as these before and its usually kind of close to what actually happens. 

To put it in context my ex has left notes at my own businesses, shown up randomly at places where I am with no contact, has caused scenes, etc. I had to leave cause she did not treat me well or respect me by ditching, blowing me off, making fun of me and talking smack behind my back, no communication, religiously judged me, would continuously do things causing a reaction then hammer me for reacting at all, wild mood swings, can't think of others point of view/consequences for others based on her actions, wouldn't respect my boundaries, etc. so fairly mentally and emotionally abusive over time.

 i had a dream where i was in a big church and i was attending it, but it was shapped exactly as the triangular one i saw that fell in the video ( i have never been to asia, or a church like that) then i went up and grab the mic and said ‚ÄúGod im sorry i always loved you‚Äù , then in the dream i felt like something bad was about to happen, like a real bad feeling then something told me to run and get out of there fast, so i told people to do it too, only some people near the door believed me, i was able to get out, and the top of the building had glass, so the earth started to shake, as people were coming out blocks and glass fell onto them, half of the building fell and the center fell onto the people that were inside, the i looked around me and i was in a big city, and all those big buildings started falling and saw them fall. I had that dream 3 times, then 2 or 3 days later i saw the news, and the buildings looked exactly like the dream

They appear unannounced, I do end up cheating in the dreams, and they are never wanted. Some of these ex's were really toxic so why do they keep showing up in my dreams. Right when I don't remember them anymore, right when I'm in a happy moment in my life they have to come in and ruin my dreams. Why is this happening? 

One dream, I'm back in high school they put the normal charm on me book back together and dating. 

Most recent dream was some super fancy event and both of us are dressed to the 9s and I ended up kissing and loving on my ex rather than my husband. My husband sees the attention he's getting from me and is somehow getting off on it.

The dream itself doesn‚Äôt make much sense of course (like the setting, place, etc) but basically I was staying at a hotel in a small town in some rural area. Met a woman and immediately we clicked. I remember having immense feelings of love for her in this dream, and even a little bit after waking up. 

The dream ended weirdly, too. For some reason her and I were at the movies in this small town and some random dude stabbed me and took my wallet when we left the theatre. I bled out in her arms as she cried over me. Then I woke up shortly after. 

The weird thing is, I don‚Äôt remember her face. She had dark hair and was tall, and I remember thinking she was gorgeous. But not much more than that. 

After I woke up I sat at the end of my bed and just felt incredibly sad that it was just a dream. I wanted her to be real. I think it‚Äôs because I have been looking for this love ever since a breakup from a few months ago. But yeah, my brain is trying to tell me something and I don‚Äôt know what it is.

1jn5cfs,I dreamed of three magical telescopes,"So I dreamed once that I was with a group at an inn dividing some treasure or loot amongst ourselves and aside from some money, I grabbed three nice telescopes like the ones sialors used to have. When I tried them, I noticed something odd because though I pointed them to the same place and people, they looked different. Along the dream I figured out that one telescope showed an alternative present, other showed people's current wishes and the third one showed the future.

With the alternate reality telescope, I saw my city looking slightly different, like a railway bieng in place of a big highway we have. Through the one that showed people's wishes I saw a guy helping his beautiful girlfriend out of his car when in reality, who he was helping out was his elderly mom; I guess he wanted to be by himself and fidn a partner.

Then idk how I was at a cemetery and through the future telescope I saw how moss and forest had taken over the cemetery and saw just a few of the people currently visiting their loved ones, looking older and still visiting the graves in the future. After another glance, I saw those people still there but looking like they were decaying. 

In the dream I was frantically explaining to my friends what the telescopes did just before I woke up.

I'm sure there's some symbolism in there and overall those were such cool dream artifacts.

1jmyqzu,A Rabbi in My Dream Gave Me Back More Than My Olive Trees,"In the dream, I returned to an olive farm that once belonged to my late grandfather, near Marrakech. It‚Äôs a real place, full of family history and memories. My mother had planted over 500 olive trees there. But when I arrived, they were all gone. The land was bare, covered only in grass, as if nothing had ever grown there.

My mother looked at me with sadness and said something that confused me. The land had been taken by a Jewish rabbi, because our family, though Muslim, had a moral or spiritual debt toward the Jewish people that we had never fulfilled.

I couldn‚Äôt fully understand the meaning of that, but I felt it was important. So I went to meet the rabbi.

He was serious, but not hostile. There was something firm and fair in his presence. And as I listened to him, I began to feel an unexpected sense of calm. A connection. A kind of recognition. As if I had known him in another life. As if, for a moment, I too was Jewish.

He told me that every Jew has a responsibility to contribute to their nation, and that his role was to collect from those who hadn‚Äôt yet honored that duty. I didn‚Äôt fully grasp the logic, but I respected it. His words carried a kind of ancient weight, and I could sense truth behind them.

I told him how much the land meant to me, how deeply its loss hurt. He listened. Then, quietly, he agreed to return it to me.

When we went back to the farm, everything had changed. The olive trees reappeared, greener, fuller, more alive than ever. Water flowed again. People came, helping one another, planting and rebuilding. The land had become a sanctuary. There was beauty everywhere. Life felt sacred. It was as if the farm had been reborn, not only physically, but spiritually.

And the rabbi was still there, present in the silence, like a guardian of something much bigger than land or trees. In that moment, I felt a strange blessing flowing through me. A peace I had never known. A part of me felt Jewish. Not in religion, but in heart.

Later in the dream, I was invited to a Jewish wedding. I met a red-haired woman who told me she had a daughter from me, even though I wasn‚Äôt her biological father. But that didn‚Äôt matter. I felt a deep, unconditional love. I held her close. I didn‚Äôt want to let go. She was beautiful, and I somehow knew her soul. She felt like home.

I woke up with a lingering emotion I couldn‚Äôt explain. A memory of something I never lived, yet deeply recognized.

This dream left a mark on me. It wasn‚Äôt just about land, or trees, or history. It was about connection. Between peoples. Between souls. Between what we think divides us, and what actually binds us.

It made me feel something sacred for Judaism, as if I had been granted a glimpse into a wisdom I hadn‚Äôt known I needed.  
A love I didn‚Äôt expect.  
A peace I still carry.

That‚Äôs all I wanted to say.",2,1

1jn2me3,My nonexistent children,"Hello internet people. This is a throwaway account because this issue is extremely personal and I don't want to be made fun of by my close family and friends. 

For years I (21F) have had dreams of my nonexistent children. I want kids more than anything. It's hard because I don't really care about finding a partner, I just want kids of my own. 

Every time I have a dream of these kids, waking up feels like grieving them. I can see their faces in my minds eye, hear their laughs. 

For years it's been the same two kids. An older boy, maybe 7? With curly white-blonde hair. And a younger girl, 5 ish, with long dirty blonde hair. But last night was new, I dreamed of a third, a newborn baby girl. I can see her face and I remember the feeling of holding her in my arms. Anytime I'm not actively doing something, I think of her and get sad. 

I need advice. Is there any way to stop these dreams? Or to better cope with them? I talked about it with my therapist and she didn't reallt have anyrhing helpful... It will be years before I'm in a place to have children and who knows if I'll even ever find a partner.

I refuse to name these dream children because I know it will make it harder. I just don't know what to do anymore. The two older kids were hard enough, but this new baby is heartbreaking.

1jmxzmk,Weirdest dream ive ever had...,"During thursday I had my exams and after finishing them I went home and took a nap but the dream I had was probably the weirdest one ive ever had. It was me and my brother in a room that had a tv. We would be watching tv normally until I started seeing creature. I asked my brother if he could see them too, but he told me no and they are not real. Everytime I saw a creature it would be with a mirror some would be closer to me and some further away.  Everytime this happend I would ask my brother if he could see them and I kept getting the same repeated answer.  There was also a small little girl dressed like one of those 80's dolls, but something was off about her around this time. I didnt think much of it and woke up. Around 2 days later I came back home from my exams, but this time I played apex. After 1 game I felt unusually tired and it was all So sudden. I left my monitor on because its a habit of mine. I took a nap and I was back in the same dream, room. This time there was my brother, dad and a random old man I have never seen in my life watching tv once again. After some time again I started seeing them  again, but this time it was different. I was scared and for some reason I thought I was going to die. I kept asking them if they can see them, no response. The creatures vanished right after. I calmed down and this happend like 3 times before I turned off the tv and got a response. They told me I was crazy and there was nothing there and to turn on the tv. Ofcourse I didnt and suddenly I woke up, but I noticed something my monitor was off, but I could hear the game music. I thought my dad turned it off or something. Anyways I went back to sleep again and it was the same situation. Each time they came closer to me I would yellow that im going to die. At some point I snapped, turned off the tv, took the remote and went into another room it was empty just 4 walls, a door with no door and a window. As this was happening they were yelling from the other room I was screaming in fear. I said the sentence I'm gonna die around 10 times. At some point I went out of the door and soon as I did that. The same uncanny girl speed walked past me at an unhuman speed and her face changed to a 40 year old womens for a split second. This triggered me, I started panicking and ran back to the room in to a corner. Started screaming, sweating. My hands were on my head. I felt my heart race in real life. The old man came to room and held my head and told me whats wrong, it's not real over and over and over again until I woke up. The first thing I noticed was that my monitor was on. I came to a conclusion that I never woke up from the dream. The second thing I noticed was that I got a fever that I never had. My electrolites were very low and the next day when I weighed myself I had lost around 2.5kg  in just 1 day.  This was very weird, I also couldnt drink or eat.

last night i had a stalker in my dream who looked just like me and wanted to be like me, but the only difference appearance wise was that she was fat.

1jmuept,I had the weirdest loop nightmare of my life.,"For as long as I can remember, my dreams have been weird as hell. I have, in the most remarkable episodes, dreamt of: casually flying from France to Brasil (literally flying, my body, not a plane) and then taking an airplane to Japan because Korea was on fire (don't ask), floating around a building while fighting a bioluminescent version of Pemmywise the Clown, and this sort of nonsense. It's usually just funny.

Tonight, however, was creeoy. In my dream, people were told the story of a young little boy who murdered his twin sister and their older sister. It was an urban legend of some kind; after hearing the story, my family and I started seeing the bodies of little girls in the creepiest of places. It was then explained to us that to stop the visions, we had to find their actual bodies where the boy had left them, unburry them, and give them a proper funeral. We found them under a gas station (?????).

Now, this is where it gets weirder than my usual: as we unburried their bodies, the ghost of the little boy attacked us, and I woke up. Except that I didn't wake up. It was a loop. I was in my bed, my bedroom exactly as it is, but the little boy was there staring at me; I tried to scream, but it came out muffled, then I woke up again, but it was fake again. The loop repeated 6 times, and in each of them, the little boy was in a different place -I distinctly remember one when he was sitting in a chair right in front of my bed.

Does this even have a meaning???",3,1

She makes me panicked and i start trying to run towards the foyer. i see four younger woman also dressed up in black clothing in the foyer. The dresses were like Victorian style, as i am trying to leave I hear the old women scream behind me ""Get him before he escapes"". As I was a millisecond from leaving the front door threshold, the young women get a hold of me and drag me back into the estate. They hold me in the foyer, for the Older women to talk to me. she says that would make a wonderful handmaid if i didn't kept trying to escape.

It felt like I was drinking water, that has the mineral kind of grainy taste to it. They had crushed pills into the soup saying that it would make my brain all numb, and submissive. more easily to be molded they said. Then the scene changes like if ice-cream was melting on a window pane. i was dressed like the young women, sinched waist, white make up. i kind of looked like a doll, like those porcelain dolls, but with no boobs and short hair. They slowly lifted a black veil over my face as they lined me up with the other handmaiden's. My wrists felt itchy but as I looked at them, they seemed to be red, like a rash or a bruise, then the old women hits me on the wrist with the ruler because i was not standing appropriately.

1jmsyv9,I'm scared of my dreams.,"For a few months now, I have been documenting my dreams and lucid dreams. I started it as a experiment to see what my subconscious cooks up while my conscious is asleep, but strangely enough, I started to see a pattern. After every four-six dreams about nonsense like me turning into my principal's butt plug, I would sometimes get a lucid dream, or a dream more vivid then the others. It started when I was about to cross the road, and a car grazed my shoulder. It didn't really hurt, but I got a strange sense of Deja Vu. The next morning, while I was writing about the dream I had before waking up, I suddenly remembered that I had a dream of getting grazed by a white car a week ago.I wanted to check if I was right, and I was. I had wrote it down a week before of a white car grazing my shoy while I was crossing the same road. I just thought that maybe, just maybe, it was just a weird coincidence. But after a month, I realised I was horribly wrong. The coincidences kept happening, they were small, but they there. And then, it happened again. A dream of my favourite bracelet falling down in our lotus pond while I was eating chocolate ice-cream came true. It was the same as I had written in my journal. I started to get worried, but I convinced my brain into believing I was just being delusional for my own amusement again. But I was wrong.

Two weeks ago, I had a lucid dream of eating overcooked rice in my aunt's kitchen(it's a joint family, but different kitchens.) I was eating the rice with ghee and salt, while talking to my sister about how I should eat instead of searching for a video to watch while doing so. When I realised I was lucid dreaming, I began forcing change to the dream, and suddenly I was walking barefoot on a road with my mom, talking about what we should have for dinner after returning home, when a bike hit my right shoulder. I was a bit taken a back by the way my lucid dream was not working the way I wanted it to, but before I could do something else, I woke up. I wrote down the weird dream and went about my way. Until yesterday. My granddad died of heart failure yestet, and I wasn't really sad about it, because he sa'd me when I younger. But, what caught me off guard was when my aunt told me to go to her kitchen to eat some food, because I was going to my granddad's cremation, and it would be long before I had something to eat again, which was true.

Although, while eating the food, cousin S, She began scolding me about how ""You should hurry up and finish the food, before I take your phone away"", (And let me tell you something, If you are getting scolded by S for something, you should probably listen to her). And I felt a shiver down my spine. I was immediately reminded of that weird dream, and after finishing my whole plate in three minutes, I went back to grab my journal. And sure enough, she had just said the exact same thing she said while scolding me in my dream. I didn't want to think about it until after coming home, so I just shoved it in a corner of my head. 

Until when we had just completed giving my granddad's belly button back to a religious traditional river. And while walking back, my mom asked me what I wanted to eat after going home, because it was either fruits, rice, or a vibe of squishy white small balls that extend in rice when left in water for a few hours(Shabo).

I froze on the spot, as the recollections of that dream came crashing down me.  We were having the same conversation I had in my dream, for the 2th time today, and both of those conversations were from the same dream, and experiencing the same events. I just zoned out after that. And now, I'm writing this while laying beside my asleep, now widowed grandma, writing this as I notice the white figure out of the corner of my eyes.

1jmu4o3,Are dreams past life memories (theory),"According to the Biddhist religion, we all reincarnate, so is it possible the images in our heads are fragments of multiple lives we lived in the past?  For example, we all probably have multiple memorable experiences in this lifetime deeply ingrained in our subconscious.  What if those experiences are 5 second segments in a dream the next life and the other segments are other past lives meshed into one dream: sleeping is a mechanism to be grounded in our roots, so we are reminded of our past lives?

I find this theory interesting.  I am deeply drawn to the concept of past lives because of the many instances of young children remembering their past lives. If anybody versed in reincarnation can explain more, please educate me.",2,4

1jmywvn,Recurring Dream that Hurts,"A few days ago I was very sick and sleep brought fever dreams. Near the end of the illness I had a dream that has since been repeating itself and it hurts. My dream had me on the verge of understanding the infinite vastness of space, and by this I don‚Äôt only mean how infinitely space stretches out but also how there is infinite space between me two cupped hands, or how there is infinite space between 1 and 2. In my dream, I was on the verge of fully being able to comprehend this, but of course I woke up. That said, not only has this dream started repeating itself, at all times I can still almost feel that I have fully grasped this concept that is beyond human understanding. Mind you, while we can describe infinity, we can‚Äôt actually grasp it. And I will also add all of this includes dimensional space as well. It actually hurts to think about but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it either. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on the verge of cosmic bliss.",1,2
1jmotsv,"I tried to paint the logo of my upcoming indie game, Dreamwalker","
(I have no painting experience)

One year ago, I was asked to create a game with a buddy of mine. After cycling through plenty of bad ideas, we finally settled on a concept we thought would set our game apart. The idea was that the player, a traveler, would stumble upon a cursed village where every villager was trapped in an eternal slumber. The player would soon discover they were a ""Dreamwalker,"" capable of entering each villager‚Äôs dreams. Initially, we imagined the player would simply battle a nightmare within each dream, but our idea quickly expanded. Soon, each villager had their own unique dreamscape with individual stories, puzzles and entirely different visuals. 

A few months later, we found ourselves deep down the rabbit hole, having developed multiple topdown puzzles, a full quest system, deck-building combat, 4 rarity cards, upgradeble cards, shop and tradeup system, over 10 dreamscapes, and much more. Eventually, we decided to dedicate all of our spare time over the next year toward fully releasing our game on Steam.

That Terrified me right off the bat, I tried to think ‚Äòno way I saw it wrong‚Äô but I couldn‚Äôt move past it. Then in a few minutes he was at my back door trying to ask me out. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen I was in, closed the door and called the cops
He didn‚Äôt like that.
He burst in, tried to grab me, I fought him off and I can‚Äôt remember if I killed him or not but I remember him chasing me through the hotels hallway with a butcher knife and saying some mess like how they want me? (In a sexual context). It was terrifying but I‚Äôm pretty sure I slashed his throat open.

And it doesn‚Äôt stop there. There were 3 parts to this dream.

The second part I was in a house similar to my home, I was in the bathroom wishing my mom a good day before she left and suddenly I hear the voice of a man‚Ä¶ I crack open my door and it‚Äôs him. The same guy.
While I‚Äôm trying not to hyperventilate he tells me I need to get out there and don‚Äôt call the cops or something..? I called the cops and somehow ended up in my brothers car, his behavior towards me was dismissive and like he didn‚Äôt care about my situation.

Then I was in a bookstore full of hot guys and normally you forget each part of dream while you‚Äôre in it right? Well, I saw a few books in the last dream‚Ä¶ they were all of faces similar to the r@pists face‚Ä¶

He had curly dirty blonde hair with ash tones and grey-blue eyes‚Ä¶ his skin looked greyish and pale

My reaction to it was like experiencing ptsd, I just stood there as the memories from the moment flooded back and now I just feel sick.


Look, Im a pretty girl that lives in a red state, I‚Äôm no stranger to being sexually harassed from a young age and being followed
But I‚Äôve had a lot of stress lately because my mom wants me to get a job and get out of the house with no car and no way to protect myself. Lately a lot of dreams have reminded me that my parents and family have never made me feel safe/ aren‚Äôt here to protect me. But this? This feels like the weight that broke the camels back.

Lit by the grey light of a cloudy day

On the first floor I'm alone

A sense of dread as I wander

A sense that I shouldn't linger here

&nbsp;

I hurry up the steps inside

Ignoring voices unfamiliar,

Old faces I've never known

Speaking of things I cannot hear.

&nbsp;

Through a doorway I walk

Passing by those who've changed

I  offer them a parting kindness

And head to the final room

&nbsp;

There are no windows, only a single door

Faces inside are familiar, but fleeting

All of them are bright and cheery

Everyone is crammed on couches

That line either side of the narrow room

&nbsp;

I pass by them all to my spot on the end

And I see my parents sitting across from me

And with them too a friendly pig

Who comes and licks my face

I ask his name, but they look unsure

They tell me he's 9 years of age

&nbsp;

And then I look across the room

At the one I would've been

We embrace, together at last

But her eyes are glassy, those of death

&nbsp;

And tangled together we fall

As the room fades away

And soon enough

We do too.",2,3
1jmxkv6,I feel like I saw another version of my life in this dream,"Some details about me before the store:
I‚Äôve always been scared at night and to sleep even sometimes, long story short on the reasons why is because I‚Äôve had a bad acid trip and I‚Äôm still unfortunately living in the same house and in the same room where it happened. So nighttime and getting to sleep are extremely hard for me.

The dream:

It started off as a nightmare, it was nighttime and I was throwing a house party? Or something at the house I live in, it was pretty full of people, and of people I didn‚Äôt recognize at all, but at the same time I did know? In real life I barely know enough people to have a small get together. So that was happening but more and more people started disappearing from the party until it was eerie silent. Everything just felt wrong and like something bad was about to happen. I remember running around the house with a baseball bat and don‚Äôt know if I was looking for someone or hiding from someone, but it just like I was being hunted or trying to hunt someone down. It got blurry here until it just transitioned into daytime. My family (consisting of my mom and three sisters) were all home again and I was upstairs with them. Everything seemed like if I was in reality with them and not dreaming, like any other day. But suddenly I get a FaceTime call, from a girl, the name was always out of focus. I get emotional because I see it‚Äôs my girlfriend (my girlfriend in the dream and not my actual girlfriend in real life). I start to get emotional and confused because I knew she was dead? And I was confused why she was FaceTiming me, I pick up and see like a corner of her room wall, the wall was an odd-white cream color, with pink posters and lights all over it, and a bit of the girls head showing on the corner of my screen. She starts crying and yelling that she‚Äôs so happy to see me again, and that she‚Äôs been trying to reach me for such a long time now. I get skeptical of how this is happening and I start talking with caution, I ask, ‚Äúhow do I know this is really you and not some deepfake AI bullshit?‚Äù Then she writes down a secret only her and I know, and the nickname she calls me onto a white door with some red writing utensil. And I knew it all to be true, even though the information I read wasn‚Äôt a secret anyone ever told me, and the nickname wasn‚Äôt a nickname my actual girlfriend calls me, or anyone of my exes ever called me. Once I read this information I break into tears, tears so real when I finally woke up I had to check my cheeks to make sure there wasn‚Äôt streaks running down.  She starts crying too, in a high pitched, gentle kind of way. She tells me how much she misses me, how much she loves me, how she just can‚Äôt believe she can see me again. But then the dream starts to fade, I can feel myself waking up maybe? And this is the freakiest part, as it all was fading it‚Äôs like she realized it was. So her last words to me were something among the lines of‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you *my real name*, and I‚Äôll miss you for *something, something, I can‚Äôt remember*, and I‚Äôll always be with you.‚Äù

Then I woke up. And I couldn‚Äôt believe that i wasn‚Äôt already awake.

I‚Äôve had really hyper realistic dreams before, but nowhere near to this degree. Also I never usually dream, because my dreams are always nightmares or no dreams at all. So this was just a complete reality shatter. I can also describe this girl in great detail:

Her skin tone was brown, a medium between light skin brown and dark skinned brown. She had short but full, black curly hair, it was very wavy and bouncy? If that makes sense. Her eyes were hazel and with long eyelashes. Her lips were small but plump and pink. Her head was a bit small but her facial features were unique and recognizable. A ‚Äúperfect‚Äù noise, of sorts, it wasn‚Äôt crooked or anything, just perfectly sat in the middle. Her voice was soft, gentle, warming, and comforting. When she yelled it wasn‚Äôt like a typical yell but a soft one. She had a huge smile, with a small jawline and very visible neck and that high pitch soft cry. She wore a black and red flannel with a white tank top underneath. I never saw her name, so I‚Äôm not sure what that was. Now I have never dated or even been friends with anyone who matches this description, but I just knew she was my soul mate in this dream, the emotions were so powerful I can still feel them. I don‚Äôt know where this came from, but it was really insane how she seemed to be aware of when I was waking up and the dream was fading.

I don‚Äôt know what to think of this, I‚Äôm still sitting with all these feelings and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. ",1,0

I rose up from the ground in a decently sized dirt pit, and around the pit it sloped up into a seating area like that of a arena - Of course past that everything was you know hellish and red. The dream gets fuzzy at this point but i remember picking up some kind of weapon - something blunt and heavy at the very least and having to fight somebody or something else with it, it was at this point the dream ended.

Could this have any meaning?",1,0

1jmwy71,Elon Musk shot my school up.,"(*TW FOR GUN VIOLENCE!)*

Probably the most horrifying shit to have ever played in my mind. I'm a US high school senior and have always been TERRIFIED at the probability of being shot at. So what better person to do so than fucking Musk himself? In my dream he disguised himself as staff and was leisurely watching students eat lunch like all the important pricks at my school do. Well he was until the fucking FEDS stormed the building looking for him, with correlated into a RDR2 style showdown. I survived in this dream but had seen so many of my peers die. As fucking stupid as the dream sounds I woke up in cold sweat the next morning and skipped.",1,0
1jmln8r,Gone for 12 and a half years,"Yesterday when i came home from university i wanted to sleep for a hour, i set my alarm and i went for a nap. Now the dream starts. The dream started with me in my room to the exact detail(from what i can recall) and i just went on with my life. I finished university. Got 2 job applications. Over a span of 5 years. Met a girl when i was in masters but broke up with her after 2 years. Met another one after 1 year and it didn't go well so we ended things after 8 months. Then a year later i met my soon to be wife somewhere in april. We went on vacations with my friends from real life. I saw them and me getting older. I saw my parents getting older. I was working as a maintenance engineer. We switched cities because i needed to for work. My friends also switched cities. We would still talk but we will see each other rarely. We went on vacations tho. I would see my parents less and less but it didn't bother me. I had a time skip because i never went on a plane in real life so my mind doesn't know the feeling of flying in a plane. Everything, the taste, the touch of things i could feel. So after some time, at the end of the dream, i came home exhausted after a long day at work and it was February so i made a fire in the fireplace and sat on the couch and fell asleep. That was the moment when i woke up in my bed in my house from real life. I ran at the bathroom confused and panicked and i realised it was a dream. Now i have a severe sense of grief for my wife, for my kid that was on the way, for my life in general. I am confused and sad. All the buildings and roads that evolved over time in the dream are the same in real life. They feel old even if they remained the same. I  met some friends at the night and i almost burst out tearing. They grew old with me in the dream, yet they remained the same in real life. Everything seems out of place. Anyone who has experienced this and is willing to share his experience feel free to dm me. I've always had vivid dreams, since i was little, but nothing like this so it took me by surprise, by shock even. Thanks for your time and i hope you have a wonderful day!

1jmo9sx,Dreams about suicide and human sacrifice?,"Hey, so I just woke up from a disturbing dream but this was not the first.. I‚Äôm going to put as NSFW because I‚Äôm not sure.
So the dream I just had it first started off with my exes girlfriend coming into I guess a nail salon while I was sorting through items. Then later on I go into a place where I‚Äôm just talking, the place was at my old/mom‚Äôs house but very cluttered. And there was really bad wind outside the house and some numerous puppies (I do irl have 3 dogs but they didn‚Äôt look like them) just kept running outside. With the wind I couldn‚Äôt open the door and save them. So I was just staring through the window trying to call them in.. Later someone else, I think it was Elvis Presley, went house and was driving a car into the puppies house, and I guess killed them because he didn‚Äôt want to see them suffer. later he went to the window and started chanting ‚Äúyou will suffer‚Äù and then the language changed to Portuguese and everyone in my dream grabbed a sword and shoved it down their throats and the end.. 

In another past dream I had it was around with my older brother and his gf, their relationship came to be toxic in a way. She left awhile ago because she couldn‚Äôt handle it. Backstory.. she had 2 kids back to back and her father passed. She had really bad postpartum and she tried to leave. Anyway in the dream we were all on the phone with her and we just hear a gun shut off. And we were scared to think that she klled herself. But later when I go to see her she‚Äôs still alive..? 

I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm dreaming this stuff, I‚Äôve never had graphic dreams like this so I need help understanding.. I can‚Äôt really shake these type of dreams off.. like these dreams don‚Äôt start off as a nightmare but the fear is what wakes me up.. ",3,0
1jmr1ov,dreamt my parents faked their death as a prank,"Basically what the title says. In my dream me, my sister, and my parents went to this boof ass hotel. After we got assigned our room and key we went to go put our shit away as usual. Only thing was that instead of a proper elevator, there was a shitty pulley system attached to a giant tote bag and u had to pull urself up. As we‚Äôre making our way up, the bag snaps. my sister and i managed to catch ourselves but my parents fell like 20 stories and went splat. i remember being so disoriented. it felt so real and i couldn‚Äôt gather my thoughts or nothing. i called 911 but i was in so much shock i just let my phone sit there and by the time i remembered what i was doing, i looked and the call time was at ten minutes and running. my sister was close by sobbing and the 911 operator was ranting about animal crossing. anyway after a bit more stumbling, shock, and processing, my mom walks out kinda laughing (?) and i remember figuring out my dad was okay too but these facts provided me no relief. i woke up right after this with tears running down my face. that is the most emotional distress i‚Äôve been in in a while, awake or not. does this mean anything at all. 

maybe important to note i‚Äôm on day 17 of a t break. i started with weird dreams of course, but they‚Äôve become increasingly psychotic with a lot of (not faked) death involved and im concerned ",2,1
1jmqy5r,Sex dream/tactile hallucination,"Short dream, long explanation. 

Ok so for context, I‚Äôm oftentimes lucid in my dreams but only to the degree that there‚Äôs an internal monologue that is somewhat consistent with my every day self while woken up. So I can kind of process what‚Äôs happening in my dream with my more conscious awareness but it doesn‚Äôt often directly influence what happens in the dream nor am I controlling anything. 

Dream starts off, I‚Äôm in a dark bedroom and there‚Äôs literally Drake sitting in a chair against a wall (I don‚Äôt really care for Drake nor do I listen to his music so idk why). I forget exactly what he said but he was really sad and was venting to me about something. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù as I got down on my knees to hug him while he was still sitting down in the chair, kind of hunched over like he was crying. I remember feeling genuinely sorry for him and upset with him and as I was hugging him it felt really comfortable. I‚Äôm positioned on my knees facing down with my head under his head at this point for future reference. I can barely see anything because it‚Äôs already dark he‚Äôs like hovering over me while hugging me. Then he starts saying shot like ‚ÄúI love you so much [my name], you have no idea how much I love you‚Äù and then I start to somewhat realize that he‚Äôs getting a hard on like I can almost feel it approaching my face. 

At this point, of my consciousness is recognizing this and thinking ‚Äúoh, what bullshit, a guy is trying to tell me he loves me to get something sexual out of me.‚Äù I can also start to feel that his hug is tight, almost like he‚Äôs keeping me there. Not so tight that he‚Äôs obviously restraining me, but that if I tried to get out, he would be. Now, I have struggled with hypersexuality and compulsive behavior in my life. I‚Äôve dealt with some less than savory scenarios with men. So be aware of that as I keep explaining. Part of my mind is recognizing how fucked up this is, but I still feel the compulsion to act on it (i.e. start teasing it/giving head). It also didn‚Äôt feel like a normal dick. I still can‚Äôt see anything, all I‚Äôm feeling is like something pokey. My ‚Äúconscious‚Äù mind recognizes this, thinking ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt feel human.‚Äù I start to go down on him a little more, then he pulls me up and starts kissing me. The thing that started out as Drake starts to feel less human. I‚Äôve dealt with some darker sides of spirituality and sexuality before, including some really intense and scary experiences in dreams but I usually brush things off as my own unconscious mind. Including the sexual ones. But still my conscious mind is like ‚Äúthis is‚Ä¶ a threat. like this is an entity. this is not good. get out of here.‚Äù 

I have this ability to force myself out of dreams I don‚Äôt want to finish and wake up. Often times I fall asleep immediately after and am thrust back into the same dream but other times if I force myself to stay awake for long enough I‚Äôm out. So, my conscious mind has now communicated this threat to my dream self mind. As this Thing is restraining me and trying to kiss me and make me give it head, I literally break into lucidity and HISS at it like a fucking vampire snake weirdo trying to come off as threatening to this entity as I escape the dream and wake up. BUT, as I‚Äôm coming into consciousness and forcing myself to wake up, I can literally feel its hands grabbing at my head/hair/back of my neck. Like I can feel its touch on me. I was like what the actual fuck. I stayed awake long enough for the dream to not start up again.

I have experienced tactile hallucinations from dreams before (that‚Äôs what I assume they are, I‚Äôm not quick to jump towards a spiritual explanation at this point in my life). I had a lot of sleep paralysis and some night terrors as a kid, and in recent years I‚Äôve dealt with some forms of sleep paralysis that came with perceptions of real physical pain and distress even though nothing was really happening. Idk what this was but I do NOT fuck with things grabbing at my head ",2,1
1jmvwmc,I have to kill my dream demon.,"For ever since I could remember, I've been having dreams that have always terrified me & I just had another. The dreams always start out as a place I don't usually recognize at all, like liminal space but normal or unbusy, this time it was more intense. 

The dream started when I was on the east side of the mountains but had my childhood home, my own apartment & a temporary job I was working while I take a break from mine in a similar field, this time around I was working for a billionaire who ran it out of his own facility and was around alot but did things in tech, medical & tech, after working for day I found out that he was actually into the harvesting of organs like mine to survive longer & after I found that out I fled with resistance while people who vaguely resembled people at work attacked me trying to stop me from leaving, I left once and was followed sorta but not fully taken, so I returned under a new alias and look & went ahead and he sorta knew as I worked again. He showed me something by a cabinet and I killed him with a blade from behind, doing so, the staff attacked me even harder as I fled out the front, even feeling being injured by them, before I saw one employee clearly scared and fleeing too after I told them. I left for the lot then got into my car and drove away erratically while trying to be stopped and made it to my childhood home where I was gonna sleep to my grandpa, however it wasn't him and the backdoors were unlocked, I called 911 to wait but nothing then I realized and woke up.

And I found a pattern, it can't manifest personal places because the home was like it but very unusual and not layed out right, the job place was all over and the town was unfamiliar, it also flees as someone else everytime like the employee I saw in disguise before calling me as a fake.

It happens about every month or so when I start to forget about it, and last months was similar.

It started when I was in movie theater and threats of a gunman was around so many people fled out the back into liminal neighborhoods at night, hiding while some was people I knew, hiding in this small area of liminal neighborhoods, a red truck came up with multiple people getting out, killing people I knew and everyone who was seen, some where taken out by others I knew and one I got before it got me, but the last disguised one I killed with a gun it dropped after a physical fight, where the dream instantly ended & was in a standstill like I had done something before waking up, however I remember one of truck members slipping out behind the truck beyond the borders of this liminal like area. 

I have these dream every so often and everytime I kill the thing that's hunting me but whatever flees during it always comes back & once I forget, I have to re-experience a liminal like dream & kill it again. I haven't been caught or killed yet but I feel every bit of pain & detailed injury that occurs and the dreams always play off the fear of people & never have consistency of why. I can't remember the first time I had one like this, but I know I did since I was kid

Edit: its horrible because when I do dream about places and concepts that are amazing or beautiful these dreams occur then i cannot dream for a good while at all. Only when I start to get more dreams that I can vividly remember and like the idea of it happens and puts me back at nothing",1,0
